<h1><a name="backuppc_introduction">BackupPC Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This documentation describes BackupPC version 3.0.0,
released on 28 Jan 2007.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>BackupPC is a high-performance, enterprise-grade system for backing up
Unix, Linux, WinXX, and MacOSX PCs, desktops and laptops to a server's
disk.  BackupPC is highly configurable and easy to install and maintain.</p>
<p>Given the ever decreasing cost of disks and raid systems, it is now
practical and cost effective to backup a large number of machines onto
a server's local disk or network storage.  For some sites this might be
the complete backup solution.  For other sites additional permanent
archives could be created by periodically backing up the server to tape.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A clever pooling scheme minimizes disk storage and disk I/O.
Identical files across multiple backups of the same or different PC
are stored only once (using hard links), resulting in substantial
savings in disk storage and disk writes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional compression provides additional reductions in storage
(around 40%).  The CPU impact of compression is low since only
new files (those not already in the pool) need to be compressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A powerful http/cgi user interface allows administrators to view
the current status, edit configuration, add/delete hosts, view log
files, and allows users to initiate and cancel backups and browse
and restore files from backups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The http/cgi user interface has internationalization (i18n) support,
currently providing English, French, German, Spanish, Italian,
Dutch and Portuguese-Brazilian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No client-side software is needed. On WinXX the standard smb protocol is
used to extract backup data. On linux, unix or MacOSX clients, rsync or
tar (over ssh/rsh/nfs) is used to extract backup data. Alternatively,
rsync can also be used on WinXX (using cygwin), and Samba could be
installed on the linux or unix client to provide smb shares).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexible restore options.  Single files can be downloaded from
any backup directly from the CGI interface.  Zip or Tar archives
for selected files or directories from any backup can also be
downloaded from the CGI interface.  Finally, direct restore to
the client machine (using smb or tar) for selected files or
directories is also supported from the CGI interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BackupPC supports mobile environments where laptops are only
intermittently connected to the network and have dynamic IP addresses
(DHCP).  Configuration settings allow machines connected via slower WAN
connections (eg: dial up, DSL, cable) to not be backed up, even if they
use the same fixed or dynamic IP address as when they are connected
directly to the LAN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexible configuration parameters allow multiple backups to be performed
in parallel, specification of which shares to backup, which directories
to backup or not backup, various schedules for full and incremental
backups, schedules for email reminders to users and so on.  Configuration
parameters can be set system-wide or also on a per-PC basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users are sent periodic email reminders if their PC has not
recently been backed up.  Email content, timing and policies
are configurable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BackupPC is Open Source software hosted by SourceForge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="backup_basics">Backup basics</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_full_backup">Full Backup</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>A full backup is a complete backup of a share. BackupPC can be
configured to do a full backup at a regular interval (typically
weekly).  BackupPC can be configured to keep a certain number
of full backups.  Exponential expiry is also supported, allowing
full backups with various vintages to be kept (for example, a
settable number of most recent weekly fulls, plus a settable
number of older fulls that are 2, 4, 8, or 16 weeks apart).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_incremental_backup">Incremental Backup</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>An incremental backup is a backup of files that have changed
since the last successful full or incremental backup.  Starting
in BackupPC 3.0 multi-level incrementals are supported.
A full backup has level 0.  A new incremental of level N will
backup all files that have changed since the most recent backup
of a lower level.  <a href="#item__conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</A> is used to specify the
level of each successive incremental.  The default value is
all level 1, which makes the behavior the same as earlier
versions of BackupPC: each incremental will back up all the
files that changed since the last full (level 0).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For SMB and tar, BackupPC uses the modification time (mtime) to
determine which files have changed since the last lower-level
backup.  That mean SMB and tar incrementals are not able to detect
deleted files, renamed files or new files whose modification time
is prior to the last lower-level backup.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Rsync is more clever: any files whose attributes have changed (ie: uid,
gid, mtime, modes, size) since the last full are backed up.  Deleted,
new files and renamed files are detected by Rsync incrementals.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>BackupPC can also be configured to keep a certain number of incremental
backups, and to keep a smaller number of very old incremental backups.
If multi-level incrementals are specified then it is likely that
more incrementals will need to be kept since lower-level incrementals
(and the full backup) are needed to reconstruct a higher-level
incremental.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>BackupPC ``fills-in'' incremental backups when browsing or restoring,
based on the levels of each backup, giving every backup a ``full''
appearance.  This makes browsing and restoring backups much easier:
you can restore from any one backup independent of whether it was
an incremental or full.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_partial_backup">Partial Backup</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>When a full backup fails or is canceled, and some files have already
been backed up, BackupPC keeps a partial backup containing just the
files that were backed up successfully.  The partial backup is removed
when the next successful backup completes, or if another full backup
fails resulting in a newer partial backup.  A failed full backup
that has not backed up any files, or any failed incremental backup,
is removed; no partial backup is saved in these cases.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The partial backup may be browsed or used to restore files just like
a successful full or incremental backup.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>With the rsync transfer method the partial backup is used to resume
the next full backup, avoiding the need to retransfer the file data
already in the partial backup.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_identical_files">Identical Files</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>BackupPC pools identical files using hardlinks.  By ``identical
files'' we mean files with identical contents, not necessary the
same permissions, ownership or modification time.  Two files might
have different permissions, ownership, or modification time but
will still be pooled whenever the contents are identical.  This
is possible since BackupPC stores the file meta-data (permissions,
ownership, and modification time) separately from the file contents.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_backup_policy">Backup Policy</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Based on your site's requirements you need to decide what your backup
policy is.  BackupPC is not designed to provide exact re-imaging of
failed disks.  See <a href="#limitations">Limitations</a> for more information.
However, the addition of tar transport for linux/unix clients, plus
full support for special file types and unix attributes in v1.4.0
likely means an exact image of a linux/unix file system can be made.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>BackupPC saves backups onto disk. Because of pooling you can relatively
economically keep several weeks of old backups.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>At some sites the disk-based backup will be adequate, without a
secondary tape backup. This system is robust to any single failure: if a
client disk fails or loses files, the BackupPC server can be used to
restore files. If the server disk fails, BackupPC can be restarted on a
fresh file system, and create new backups from the clients. The chance
of the server disk failing can be made very small by spending more money
on increasingly better RAID systems.  However, there is still the risk
of catastrophic events like fires or earthquakes that can destroy
both the BackupPC server and the clients it is backing up if they
are physically nearby.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Some sites might choose to do periodic backups to tape or cd/dvd.
This backup can be done perhaps weekly using the archive function of
BackupPC.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Other users have reported success with removable disks to rotate the
BackupPC data drives, or using rsync to mirror the BackupPC data pool
offsite.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="item_other_programs_of_interest">Other Programs of Interest</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If you want to mirror linux or unix files or directories to a remote server
you should use rsync, <a href="http://rsync.samba.org">http://rsync.samba.org</a>.  BackupPC uses
rsync as a transport mechanism; if you are already an rsync user you
can think of BackupPC as adding efficient storage (compression and
pooling) and a convenient user interface to rsync.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Two popular open source packages that do tape backup are
Amanda (<a href="http://www.amanda.org">http://www.amanda.org</a>)
and Bacula (<a href="http://www.bacula.org">http://www.bacula.org</a>).
Amanda can also backup WinXX machines to tape using samba.
These packages can be used as back ends to BackupPC to backup the
BackupPC server data to tape.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Various programs and scripts use rsync to provide hardlinked backups.
See, for example, Mike Rubel's site (<a href="http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots">http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots</a>),
JW Schultz's dirvish (<a href="http://www.dirvish.org/">http://www.dirvish.org/</a>),
Ben Escoto's rdiff-backup (<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup">http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup</a>),
and John Bowman's rlbackup (<a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/imaging/rlbackup">http://www.math.ualberta.ca/imaging/rlbackup</a>).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Unison is a utility that can do two-way, interactive, synchronization.
See <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/unison">http://freshmeat.net/projects/unison</a>.  An external wrapper around
rsync that maintains transfer data to enable two-way synchronization is
drsync; see <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/drsync">http://freshmeat.net/projects/drsync</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>BackupPC provides many additional features, such as compressed storage,
hardlinking any matching files (rather than just files with the same name),
and storing special files without root privileges.  But these other programs
provide simple, effective and fast solutions and are definitely worthy of
consideration.</p>

<h2><a name="you_can_help">You can help</a></h2>
<p>BackupPC is free. I work on BackupPC because I enjoy doing it and I like

<p>BackupPC already has more than enough features for my own needs.  The
main compensation for continuing to work on BackupPC is knowing that
more and more people find it useful.  So feedback is certainly
appreciated, both positive and negative.</p>
<p>Beyond being a satisfied user and telling other people about it, everyone
is encouraged to add links to <a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net">http://backuppc.sourceforge.net</a>
(I'll see them via Google) or otherwise publicize BackupPC.  Unlike
the commercial products in this space, I have a zero budget (in both
time and money) for marketing, PR and advertising, so it's up to
all of you!  Feel free to vote for BackupPC at
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/backuppc">http://freshmeat.net/projects/backuppc</a>.</p>
<p>Also, everyone is encouraged to contribute patches, bug reports, feature

<h1><a name="installing_backuppc">Installing BackupPC</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>BackupPC requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A linux, solaris, or unix based server with a substantial amount of free
disk space (see the next section for what that means). The CPU and disk
performance on this server will determine how many simultaneous backups
you can run. You should be able to run 4-8 simultaneous backups on a
moderately configured server.</p>
<p>Several users have reported significantly better performance using
reiser compared to ext3 for the BackupPC data file system.  It is
also recommended you consider either an LVM or raid setup (either
in HW or SW; eg: 3Ware RAID5) so that you can expand the
file system as necessary.</p>
<p>When BackupPC starts with an empty pool, all the backup data will be
written to the pool on disk. After more backups are done, a higher
percentage of incoming files will already be in the pool. BackupPC is
able to avoid writing to disk new files that are already in the pool.
So over time disk writes will reduce significantly (by perhaps a factor
of 20 or more), since eventually 95% or more of incoming backup files
are typically in the pool. Disk reads from the pool are still needed to
do file compares to verify files are an exact match. So, with a mature
pool, if a relatively fast client generates data at say 1MB/sec, and you
run 4 simultaneous backups, there will be an average server disk load of
about 4MB/sec reads and 0.2MB/sec writes (assuming 95% of the incoming
files are in the pool). These rates will be perhaps 40% lower if
compression is on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perl version 5.8.0 or later.  If you don't have perl, please
see <a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perl modules Compress::Zlib, Archive::Zip and File::RsyncP.  Try ``perldoc
Compress::Zlib'' and ``perldoc Archive::Zip'' to see if you have these
modules.  If not, fetch them from <a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a> and see the
instructions below for how to build and install them.</p>
<p>The File::RsyncP module is available from <a href="http://perlrsync.sourceforge.net">http://perlrsync.sourceforge.net</a>
or CPAN.  You'll need to install the File::RsyncP module if you want to use
Rsync as a transport method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using smb to backup WinXX machines you need smbclient and
nmblookup from the samba package.  You will also need nmblookup if
you are backing up linux/unix DHCP machines.  See <a href="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</a>.
Samba versions 3.x are stable and now recommended instead of 2.x.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</a> for source and binaries.  It's pretty easy to
fetch and compile samba, and just grab smbclient and nmblookup, without
doing the installation. Alternatively, <a href="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</a> has binary
distributions for most platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using tar to backup linux/unix machines you should have version
1.13.7 at a minimum, with version 1.13.20 or higher recommended.  Use
``tar --version'' to check your version.  Various GNU mirrors have the newest
versions of tar, see for example <a href="http://www.funet.fi/pub/gnu/alpha/gnu/tar">http://www.funet.fi/pub/gnu/alpha/gnu/tar</a>.
As of July 2006 the latest version is 1.15.1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using rsync to backup linux/unix machines you should have
version 2.6.3 or higher on each client machine.  See
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org">http://rsync.samba.org</a>. Use ``rsync --version'' to check your version.</p>
<p>For BackupPC to use Rsync you will also need to install the perl
File::RsyncP module, which is available from
<a href="http://perlrsync.sourceforge.net">http://perlrsync.sourceforge.net</a>.
Version 0.68 or later is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Apache web server, see <a href="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</a>, preferably built
with mod_perl support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_much_disk_space_do_i_need">How much disk space do I need?</a></h2>
<p>Here's one real example for an environment that is backing up 65 laptops
with compression off. Each full backup averages 3.2GB. Each incremental
backup averages about 0.2GB. Storing one full backup and two incremental
backups per laptop is around 240GB of raw data. But because of the
pooling of identical files, only 87GB is used.  This is without
compression.</p>
<p>Another example, with compression on: backing up 95 laptops, where
each backup averages 3.6GB and each incremental averages about 0.3GB.
Keeping three weekly full backups, and six incrementals is around
1200GB of raw data.  Because of pooling and compression, only 150GB
is needed.</p>
<p>Here's a rule of thumb. Add up the disk usage of all the machines you
want to backup (210GB in the first example above). This is a rough
minimum space estimate that should allow a couple of full backups and at
least half a dozen incremental backups per machine. If compression is on
you can reduce the storage requirements by maybe 30-40%.  Add some margin
in case you add more machines or decide to keep more old backups.</p>
<p>Your actual mileage will depend upon the types of clients, operating
systems and applications you have. The more uniform the clients and
applications the bigger the benefit from pooling common files.</p>
<p>For example, the Eudora email tool stores each mail folder in a separate
file, and attachments are extracted as separate files. So in the sadly
common case of a large attachment emailed to many recipients, Eudora
will extract the attachment into a new file. When these machines are
backed up, only one copy of the file will be stored on the server, even
though the file appears in many different full or incremental backups. In
this sense Eudora is a ``friendly'' application from the point of view of
backup storage requirements.</p>
<p>An example at the other end of the spectrum is Outlook. Everything
(email bodies, attachments, calendar, contact lists) is stored in a
single file, which often becomes huge. Any change to this file requires
a separate copy of the file to be saved during backup. Outlook is even
more troublesome, since it keeps this file locked all the time, so it
cannot be read by smbclient whenever Outlook is running.  See the
<a href="#limitations">Limitations</a> section for more discussion of this problem.</p>
<p>In addition to total disk space, you shold make sure you have
plenty of inodes on your BackupPC data partition. Some users have
reported running out of inodes on their BackupPC data partition.
So even if you have plenty of disk space, BackupPC will report
failures when the inodes are exhausted.  This is a particular
problem with ext2/ext3 file systems that have a fixed number of
inodes when the file system is built.  Use ``df -i'' to see your
inode usage.</p>

<h2><a name="step_1__getting_backuppc">Step 1: Getting BackupPC</a></h2>
<p>Some linux distributions now include BackupPC.  The Debian
distribution, supprted by Ludovic Drolez, can be found at
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/backuppc">http://packages.debian.org/backuppc</a>; it should be included
in the next stable Debian release.  On Debian, BackupPC can
be installed with the command:</p>
<pre>
    apt-get install backuppc</pre>
<p>In the future there might be packages for Gentoo and other
linux flavors.  If the packaged version is older than the
released version then you will probably want to install the
latest version as described below.</p>
<p>Otherwise, manually fetching and installing BackupPC is easy.
Start by downloading the latest version from
<a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net">http://backuppc.sourceforge.net</a>.  Hit the ``Code'' button,
then select the ``backuppc'' or ``backuppc-beta'' package and
download the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_2__installing_the_distribution">Step 2: Installing the distribution</a></h2>
<p>First off, there are three perl modules you should install.
These are all optional, but highly recommended:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_compress_3a_3azlib">Compress::Zlib</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>To enable compression, you will need to install Compress::Zlib
from <a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>.
You can run ``perldoc Compress::Zlib'' to see if this module is installed.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_archive_3a_3azip">Archive::Zip</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>To support restore via Zip archives you will need to install
Archive::Zip, also from <a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>.
You can run ``perldoc Archive::Zip'' to see if this module is installed.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_xml_3a_3arss">XML::RSS</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>To support the RSS feature you will need to install XML::RSS, also from
<a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>.  There is not need to install this module if you
don't plan on using RSS. You can run ``perldoc XML::RSS'' to see if this
module is installed.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_file_3a_3arsyncp">File::RsyncP</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>To use rsync and rsyncd with BackupPC you will need to install File::RsyncP.
You can run ``perldoc File::RsyncP'' to see if this module is installed.
File::RsyncP is available from <a href="http://perlrsync.sourceforge.net">http://perlrsync.sourceforge.net</a>.
Version 0.52 or later is required.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>To build and install these packages, fetch the tar.gz file and
then run these commands:</p>
<pre>
    tar zxvf Archive-Zip-1.16.tar.gz
    cd Archive-Zip-1.16
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install</pre>
<p>The same sequence of commands can be used for each module.</p>
<p>Now let's move onto BackupPC itself.  After fetching
BackupPC-3.0.0.tar.gz, run these commands as root:</p>
<pre>
    tar zxf BackupPC-3.0.0.tar.gz
    cd BackupPC-3.0.0
    perl configure.pl</pre>
<p>In the future this release might also have patches available on the
SourceForge site.  These patch files are text files, with a name of
the form</p>
<pre>
    BackupPC-3.0.0plN.diff</pre>
<p>where N is the patch level, eg: pl2 is patch-level 2.  These
patch files are cumulative: you only need apply the last patch
file, not all the earlier patch files.  If a patch file is
available, eg: BackupPC-3.0.0pl2.diff, you should apply
the patch after extracting the tar file:</p>
<pre>
     # fetch BackupPC-3.0.0.tar.gz
     # fetch BackupPC-3.0.0pl2.diff
     tar zxf BackupPC-3.0.0.tar.gz
     cd BackupPC-3.0.0
     patch -p0 &lt; ../BackupPC-3.0.0pl2.diff
     perl configure.pl</pre>
<p>A patch file includes comments that describe that bug fixes
and changes.  Feel free to review it before you apply the patch.</p>
<p>The configure.pl script also accepts command-line options if you
wish to run it in a non-interactive manner.  It has self-contained
documentation for all the command-line options, which you can
read with perldoc:</p>
<pre>
    perldoc configure.pl</pre>
<p>Starting with BackupPC 3.0.0, the configure.pl script by default
complies with the file system hierarchy conventions.  The major
difference compared to earlier versions is that by default
configuration files will be stored in /etc/BackupPC
rather than below the data directory, __TOPDIR__/conf,
and the log files will be stored in /var/log/BackupPC.
rather than below the data directory, __TOPDIR__/log.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier version the configure.pl script
will keep the configuration files and log files in their original
location.</p>
<p>When you run configure.pl you will be prompted for the full paths
of various executables, and you will be prompted for the following
information.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_backuppc_user">BackupPC User</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>It is best if BackupPC runs as a special user, eg backuppc, that has
limited privileges. It is preferred that backuppc belongs to a system
administrator group so that sys admin members can browse backuppc files,
edit the configuration files and so on. Although configurable, the
default settings leave group read permission on pool files, so make
sure the BackupPC user's group is chosen restrictively.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>On this installation, this is __BACKUPPCUSER__.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For security purposes you might choose to configure the BackupPC
user with the shell set to /bin/false.  Since you might need to
run some BackupPC programs as the BackupPC user for testing
purposes, you can use the -s option to su to explicitly run
a shell, eg:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    su -s /bin/bash __BACKUPPCUSER__</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Depending upon your configuration you might also need the -l option.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_data_directory">Data Directory</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>You need to decide where to put the data directory, below which
all the BackupPC data is stored.  This needs to be a big file system.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>On this installation, this is __TOPDIR__.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_install_directory">Install Directory</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>You should decide where the BackupPC scripts, libraries and documentation
should be installed, eg: /usr/local/BackupPC.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>On this installation, this is __INSTALLDIR__.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_cgi_bin_directory">CGI bin Directory</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>You should decide where the BackupPC CGI script resides.  This will
usually be below Apache's cgi-bin directory.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>On this installation, this is __CGIDIR__.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_apache_image_directory">Apache image directory</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>A directory where BackupPC's images are stored so that Apache can
serve them.  This should be somewhere under Apache's DocumentRoot
directory.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_config_and_log_directories">Config and Log directories</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>In this installation the configuration and log directories are
located in the following locations:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    __CONFDIR__/config.pl    main config file
    __CONFDIR__/hosts        hosts file
    __CONFDIR__/pc/HOST.pl   per-pc config file
    __LOGDIR__/BackupPC      log files, pid, status</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The configure.pl script doesn't prompt for these locations but
they can be set for new installations using command-line options.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_3__setting_up_config_pl">Step 3: Setting up config.pl</a></h2>
<p>After running configure.pl, browse through the config file,
__CONFDIR__/config.pl, and make sure all the default settings
are correct. In particular, you will need to decide whether to use
smb, tar or rsync transport (or whether to set it on a per-PC basis)
and set the relevant parameters for that transport method.
See the section <a href="#step_5__client_setup">Client Setup</a> for more details.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_4__setting_up_the_hosts_file">Step 4: Setting up the hosts file</a></h2>
<p>The file __CONFDIR__/hosts contains the list of clients to backup.
BackupPC reads this file in three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upon startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When BackupPC is sent a HUP (-1) signal.  Assuming you installed the
init.d script, you can also do this with ``/etc/init.d/backuppc reload''.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the modification time of the hosts file changes.  BackupPC
checks the modification time once during each regular wakeup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you change the hosts file (to add or remove a host) you can
either do a kill -HUP BackupPC_pid or simply wait until the next regular
wakeup period.</p>
<p>Each line in the hosts file contains three fields, separated
by white space:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_host_name">Host name</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This is typically the host name or NetBios name of the client machine
and should be in lower case.  The host name can contain spaces (escape
with a backslash), but it is not recommended.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Please read the section <a href="#how_backuppc_finds_hosts">How BackupPC Finds Hosts</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In certain cases you might want several distinct clients to refer
to the same physical machine.  For example, you might have a database
you want to backup, and you want to bracket the backup of the database
with shutdown/restart using <a href="#item__conf_dumppreusercmd_">$Conf{DumpPreUserCmd}</A> and <a href="#item__conf_dumppostusercmd_">$Conf{DumpPostUserCmd}</A>.
But you also want to backup the rest of the machine while the database
is still running.  In the case you can specify two different clients in
the host file, using any mnemonic name (eg: myhost_mysql and myhost), and
use <a href="#item__conf_clientnamealias_">$Conf{ClientNameAlias}</A> in myhost_mysql's config.pl to specify the
real host name of the machine.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_dhcp_flag">DHCP flag</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Starting with v2.0.0 the way hosts are discovered has changed and now
in most cases you should specify 0 for the DHCP flag, even if the host
has a dynamically assigned IP address.
Please read the section <a href="#how_backuppc_finds_hosts">How BackupPC Finds Hosts</a>
to understand whether you need to set the DHCP flag.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You only need to set DHCP to 1 if your client machine doesn't
respond to the NetBios multicast request:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    nmblookup myHost</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>but does respond to a request directed to its IP address:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    nmblookup -A W.X.Y.Z</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you do set DHCP to 1 on any client you will need to specify the range of
DHCP addresses to search is specified in <a href="#item__conf_dhcpaddressranges_">$Conf{DHCPAddressRanges}</A>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Note also that the <a href="#item__conf_clientnamealias_">$Conf{ClientNameAlias}</A> feature does not work for
clients with DHCP set to 1.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_user_name">User name</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This should be the unix login/email name of the user who ``owns'' or uses
this machine. This is the user who will be sent email about this
machine, and this user will have permission to stop/start/browse/restore
backups for this host.  Leave this blank if no specific person should
receive email or be allowed to stop/start/browse/restore backups
for this host.  Administrators will still have full permissions.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_more_users">More users</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Additional user names, separate by commas and with no white space,
can be specified.  These users will also have full permission in
the CGI interface to stop/start/browse/restore backups for this host.
These users will not be sent email about this host.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>The first non-comment line of the hosts file is special: it contains
the names of the columns and should not be edited.</p>
<p>Here's a simple example of a hosts file:</p>
<pre>
    host        dhcp    user      moreUsers
    farside     0       craig     jim,dave
    larson      1       gary      andy</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_5__client_setup">Step 5: Client Setup</a></h2>
<p>Three methods for getting backup data from a client are supported: smb,
tar and rsync.  Smb or rsync are the preferred methods for WinXX clients
and rsync or tar are the preferred methods for linux/unix/MacOSX clients.</p>
<p>The transfer method is set using the <a href="#item__conf_xfermethod_">$Conf{XferMethod}</A> configuration
setting. If you have a mixed environment (ie: you will use smb for some
clients and tar for others), you will need to pick the most common
choice for <a href="#item__conf_xfermethod_">$Conf{XferMethod}</A> for the main config.pl file, and then
override it in the per-PC config file for those hosts that will use
the other method.  (Or you could run two completely separate instances
of BackupPC, with different data directories, one for WinXX and the
other for linux/unix, but then common files between the different
machine types will duplicated.)</p>
<p>Here are some brief client setup notes:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_winxx">WinXX</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>One setup for WinXX clients is to set <a href="#item__conf_xfermethod_">$Conf{XferMethod}</A> to ``smb''.
Actually, rsyncd is the better method for WinXX if you are prepared to
run rsync/cygwin on your WinXX client.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you want to use rsyncd for WinXX clients you can find a pre-packaged
zip file on <a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net">http://backuppc.sourceforge.net</a>. The package is called
cygwin-rsync. It contains rsync.exe, template setup files and the
minimal set of cygwin libraries for everything to run.  The README file
contains instructions for running rsync as a service, so it starts
automatically everytime you boot your machine.  If you use rsync
to backup WinXX machines, be sure to set <a href="#item__conf_clientcharset_">$Conf{ClientCharset}</A>
correctly (eg: 'cp1252') so that the WinXX file name encoding is
correctly converted to utf8.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Otherwise, to use SMB, you can either create shares for the data you want
to backup or your can use the existing C$ share.  To create a new 
share, open ``My Computer'', right click on the drive (eg: C), and
select ``Sharing...'' (or select ``Properties'' and select the ``Sharing''
tab). In this dialog box you can enable sharing, select the share name
and permissions.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>All Windows NT based OS (NT, 2000, XP Pro), are configured by default 
to share the entire C drive as C$.  This is a special share used for 
various administration functions, one of which is to grant access to backup 
operators. All you need to do is create a new domain user, specifically 
for backup. Then add the new backup user to the built in ``Backup 
Operators'' group. You now have backup capability for any directory on 
any computer in the domain in one easy step. This avoids using 
administrator accounts and only grants permission to do exactly what you 
want for the given user, i.e.: backup.
Also, for additional security, you may wish to deny the ability for this 
user to logon to computers in the default domain policy.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If this machine uses DHCP you will also need to make sure the
NetBios name is set.  Go to Control Panel|System|Network Identification
(on Win2K) or Control Panel|System|Computer Name (on WinXP).
Also, you should go to Control Panel|Network Connections|Local Area
Connection|Properties|Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)|Properties|Advanced|WINS
and verify that NetBios is not disabled.</p>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>BackupPC needs to know the smb share user name and password for a
client machine that uses smb.  The user name is specified in
<a href="#item__conf_smbshareusername_">$Conf{SmbShareUserName}</A>. There are four ways to tell BackupPC the
smb share password:</p>
</dd>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As an environment variable BPC_SMB_PASSWD set before BackupPC starts.
If you start BackupPC manually the BPC_SMB_PASSWD variable must be set
manually first.  For backward compatibility for v1.5.0 and prior, the
environment variable PASSWD can be used if BPC_SMB_PASSWD is not set.
Warning: on some systems it is possible to see environment variables of
running processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively the BPC_SMB_PASSWD setting can be included in
/etc/init.d/backuppc, in which case you must make sure this file
is not world (other) readable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a configuration variable <a href="#item__conf_smbsharepasswd_">$Conf{SmbSharePasswd}</A> in
__CONFDIR__/config.pl.  If you put the password
here you must make sure this file is not world (other) readable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a configuration variable <a href="#item__conf_smbsharepasswd_">$Conf{SmbSharePasswd}</A> in the per-PC
configuration file (__CONFDIR__/pc/$host.pl or
__TOPDIR__/pc/$host/config.pl in non-FHS versions of BackupPC).
You will have to use this option if the smb share password is different
for each host. If you put the password here you must make sure this file
is not world (other) readable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Placement and protection of the smb share password is a possible
security risk, so please double-check the file and directory
permissions.  In a future version there might be support for
encryption of this password, but a private key will still have to
be stored in a protected place.  Suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>As an alternative to setting <a href="#item__conf_xfermethod_">$Conf{XferMethod}</A> to ``smb'' (using
smbclient) for WinXX clients, you can use an smb network filesystem (eg:
ksmbfs or similar) on your linux/unix server to mount the share,
and then set <a href="#item__conf_xfermethod_">$Conf{XferMethod}</A> to ``tar'' (use tar on the network
mounted file system).</p>
<p>Also, to make sure that file names with special characters are correctly
transferred by smbclient you should make sure that the smb.conf file
has (for samba 3.x):</p>
<pre>
    [global]
        unix charset = UTF8</pre>
<p>UTF8 is the default setting, so if the parameter is missing then it
is ok.  With this setting <a href="#item__conf_clientcharset_">$Conf{ClientCharset}</A> should be emtpy,
since smbclient has already converted the file names to utf8.</p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_linux_2funix">Linux/Unix</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>The preferred setup for linux/unix clients is to set <a href="#item__conf_xfermethod_">$Conf{XferMethod}</A>
to ``rsync'', ``rsyncd'' or ``tar''.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You can use either rsync, smb, or tar for linux/unix machines. Smb requires
that the Samba server (smbd) be run to provide the shares. Since the smb
protocol can't represent special files like symbolic links and fifos,
tar and rsync are the better transport methods for linux/unix machines.
(In fact, by default samba makes symbolic links look like the file or
directory that they point to, so you could get an infinite loop if a
symbolic link points to the current or parent directory. If you really
need to use Samba shares for linux/unix backups you should turn off the
``follow symlinks'' samba config setting. See the smb.conf manual page.)</p>

<p>You need to set <a href="#item__conf_clientcharset_">$Conf{ClientCharset}</A> to the client's charset so that
file names are correctly converted to utf8.  Use ``locale charmap''
on the client to see its charset.</p>
<p>For linux/unix machines you should not backup ``/proc''.  This directory
contains a variety of files that look like regular files but they are
special files that don't need to be backed up (eg: /proc/kcore is a
regular file that contains physical memory).  See <a href="#item__conf_backupfilesexclude_">$Conf{BackupFilesExclude}</A>.
It is safe to back up /dev since it contains mostly character-special
and block-special files, which are correctly handed by BackupPC
(eg: backing up /dev/hda5 just saves the block-special file information,
not the contents of the disk).</p>
<p>Alternatively, rather than backup all the file systems as a single
share (``/''), it is easier to restore a single file system if you backup
each file system separately.  To do this you should list each file system
mount point in <a href="#item__conf_tarsharename_">$Conf{TarShareName}</A> or <a href="#item__conf_rsyncsharename_">$Conf{RsyncShareName}</A>, and add the
--one-file-system option to <a href="#item__conf_tarclientcmd_">$Conf{TarClientCmd}</A> or <a href="#item__conf_rsyncargs_">$Conf{RsyncArgs}</A>.
In this case there is no need to exclude /proc explicitly since it looks
like a different file system.</p>
<p>Next you should decide whether to run tar over ssh, rsh or nfs. Ssh is
the preferred method. Rsh is not secure and therefore not recommended.
Nfs will work, but you need to make sure that the BackupPC user (running
on the server) has sufficient permissions to read all the files below
the nfs mount.</p>
<p>Ssh allows BackupPC to run as a privileged user on the client (eg:
root), since it needs sufficient permissions to read all the backup
files. Ssh is setup so that BackupPC on the server (an otherwise low
privileged user) can ssh as root on the client, without being prompted
for a password. There are two common versions of ssh: v1 and v2. Here
are some instructions for one way to setup ssh.  (Check which version
of SSH you have by typing ``ssh'' or ``man ssh''.)</p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_macosx">MacOSX</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>In general this should be similar to Linux/Unix machines.
In versions 10.4 and later, the native MacOSX tar works,
and also supports resource forks.  xtar is another option,
and rsync works too (although the MacOSX-supplied rsync
has an extension for extended attributes that is not
compatible with standard rsync).</p>

<p>Note that if you run rsyncd (rsync daemon), ssh is not used.

<dt><strong><a name="item_clients_that_use_dhcp">Clients that use DHCP</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If a client machine uses DHCP BackupPC needs some way to find the
IP address given the host name.  One alternative is to set dhcp
to 1 in the hosts file, and BackupPC will search a pool of IP
addresses looking for hosts.  More efficiently, it is better to
set dhcp = 0 and provide a mechanism for BackupPC to find the
IP address given the host name.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For WinXX machines BackupPC uses the NetBios name server to determine
the IP address given the host name.
For unix machines you can run nmbd (the NetBios name server) from
the Samba distribution so that the machine responds to a NetBios
name request. See the manual page and Samba documentation for more
information.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Alternatively, you can set <a href="#item__conf_nmblookupfindhostcmd_">$Conf{NmbLookupFindHostCmd}</A> to any command
that returns the IP address given the host name.</p>

<h2><a name="step_6__running_backuppc">Step 6: Running BackupPC</a></h2>
<p>The installation contains an init.d backuppc script that can be copied
to /etc/init.d so that BackupPC can auto-start on boot.
See init.d/README for further instructions.</p>
<p>BackupPC should be ready to start.  If you installed the init.d script,
then you should be able to run BackupPC with:</p>
<pre>
    /etc/init.d/backuppc start</pre>
<p>(This script can also be invoked with ``stop'' to stop BackupPC and ``reload''
to tell BackupPC to reload config.pl and the hosts file.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, just run</p>
<pre>
     __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupPC -d</pre>
<p>as user __BACKUPPCUSER__.  The -d option tells BackupPC to run as a daemon
(ie: it does an additional fork).</p>
<p>Any immediate errors will be printed to stderr and BackupPC will quit.
Otherwise, look in __LOGDIR__/LOG and verify that BackupPC reports
it has started and all is ok.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_7__talking_to_backuppc">Step 7: Talking to BackupPC</a></h2>
<p>You should verify that BackupPC is running by using BackupPC_serverMesg.
This sends a message to BackupPC via the unix (or TCP) socket and prints
the response.  Like all BackupPC programs, BackupPC_serverMesg
should be run as the BackupPC user (__BACKUPPCUSER__), so you
should</p>
<pre>
    su __BACKUPPCUSER__</pre>
<p>before running BackupPC_serverMesg.  If the BackupPC user is
configured with /bin/false as the shell, you can use the -s
option to su to explicitly run a shell, eg:</p>
<pre>
    su -s /bin/bash __BACKUPPCUSER__</pre>
<p>Depending upon your configuration you might also need
the -l option.</p>
<p>You can request status information and start and stop backups using this
interface. This socket interface is mainly provided for the CGI interface
(and some of the BackupPC sub-programs use it too).  But right now we just
want to make sure BackupPC is happy.  Each of these commands should
produce some status output:</p>
<pre>
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupPC_serverMesg status info
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupPC_serverMesg status jobs
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupPC_serverMesg status hosts</pre>
<p>The output should be some hashes printed with Data::Dumper.  If it
looks cryptic and confusing, and doesn't look like an error message,
then all is ok.</p>
<p>The jobs status should initially show just BackupPC_trashClean.
The hosts status should produce a list of every host you have listed
in __CONFDIR__/hosts as part of a big cryptic output line.</p>
<p>You can also request that all hosts be queued:</p>
<pre>
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupPC_serverMesg backup all</pre>
<p>At this point you should make sure the CGI interface works since
it will be much easier to see what is going on.  That's our
next subject.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_8__checking_email_delivery">Step 8: Checking email delivery</a></h2>
<p>The script BackupPC_sendEmail sends status and error emails to
the administrator and users.  It is usually run each night
by BackupPC_nightly.</p>
<p>To verify that it can run sendmail and deliver email correctly
you should ask it to send a test email to you:</p>
<pre>
    su __BACKUPPCUSER__
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupPC_sendEmail -u MYNAME@MYDOMAIN.COM</pre>
<p>BackupPC_sendEmail also takes a -c option that checks if BackupPC
is running, and it sends an email to <a href="#item__conf_emailadminusername_">$Conf{EMailAdminUserName}</A>
if it is not.  That can be used as a keep-alive check by adding</p>
<pre>
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupPC_sendEmail -c</pre>
<p>to __BACKUPPCUSER__'s cron.</p>
<p>The -t option to BackupPC_sendEmail causes it to print the email
message instead of invoking sendmail to deliver the message.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_9__cgi_interface">Step 9: CGI interface</a></h2>
<p>The CGI interface script, BackupPC_Admin, is a powerful and flexible
way to see and control what BackupPC is doing.  It is written for an
Apache server.  If you don't have Apache, see <a href="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</a>.</p>
<p>There are two options for setting up the CGI interface: standard
mode and using mod_perl.  Mod_perl provides much higher performance
(around 15x) and is the best choice if your Apache was built with
mod_perl support.  To see if your apache was built with mod_perl
run this command:</p>
<pre>
    httpd -l | egrep mod_perl</pre>
<p>If this prints mod_perl.c then your Apache supports mod_perl.</p>
<p>Using mod_perl with BackupPC_Admin requires a dedicated Apache
to be run as the BackupPC user (__BACKUPPCUSER__).  This is
because BackupPC_Admin needs permission to access various files
in BackupPC's data directories.  In contrast, the standard
installation (without mod_perl) solves this problem by having
BackupPC_Admin installed as setuid to the BackupPC user, so that
BackupPC_Admin runs as the BackuPC user.</p>
<p>Here are some specifics for each setup:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_standard_setup">Standard Setup</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>The CGI interface should have been installed by the configure.pl script
in __CGIDIR__/BackupPC_Admin.  BackupPC_Admin should have been installed
as setuid to the BackupPC user (__BACKUPPCUSER__), in addition to user
and group execute permission.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You should be very careful about permissions on BackupPC_Admin and
the directory __CGIDIR__: it is important that normal users cannot
directly execute or change BackupPC_Admin, otherwise they can access
backup files for any PC. You might need to change the group ownership
of BackupPC_Admin to a group that Apache belongs to so that Apache
can execute it (don't add ``other'' execute permission!).
The permissions should look like this:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    ls -l __CGIDIR__/BackupPC_Admin
    -swxr-x---    1 __BACKUPPCUSER__   web      82406 Jun 17 22:58 __CGIDIR__/BackupPC_Admin</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The setuid script won't work unless perl on your machine was installed
with setuid emulation.  This is likely the problem if you get an error
saying such as ``Wrong user: my userid is 25, instead of 150'', meaning
the script is running as the httpd user, not the BackupPC user.
This is because setuid scripts are disabled by the kernel in most
flavors of unix and linux.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>To see if your perl has setuid emulation, see if there is a program
called sperl5.8.0 (or sperl5.8.2 etc, based on your perl version)
in the place where perl is installed. If you can't find this program,
then you have two options: rebuild and reinstall perl with the setuid
emulation turned on (answer ``y'' to the question ``Do you want to do
setuid/setgid emulation?'' when you run perl's configure script), or
switch to the mod_perl alternative for the CGI script (which doesn't
need setuid to work).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_mod_perl_setup">Mod_perl Setup</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>The advantage of the mod_perl setup is that no setuid script is needed,
and there is a huge performance advantage.  Not only does all the perl
code need to be parsed just once, the config.pl and hosts files, plus
the connection to the BackupPC server are cached between requests.  The
typical speedup is around 15 times.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>To use mod_perl you need to run Apache as user __BACKUPPCUSER__.
If you need to run multiple Apache's for different services then
you need to create multiple top-level Apache directories, each
with their own config file.  You can make copies of /etc/init.d/httpd
and use the -d option to httpd to point each http to a different
top-level directory.  Or you can use the -f option to explicitly
point to the config file.  Multiple Apache's will run on different
Ports (eg: 80 is standard, 8080 is a typical alternative port accessed
via <a href="http://yourhost.com:8080).">http://yourhost.com:8080).</a></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Inside BackupPC's Apache http.conf file you should check the
settings for ServerRoot, DocumentRoot, User, Group, and Port.  See 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/server-wide.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/server-wide.html</a> for more details.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For mod_perl, BackupPC_Admin should not have setuid permission, so
you should turn it off:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    chmod u-s __CGIDIR__/BackupPC_Admin</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>To tell Apache to use mod_perl to execute BackupPC_Admin, add this
to Apache's 1.x httpd.conf file:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    &lt;IfModule mod_perl.c&gt;
        PerlModule Apache::Registry
        PerlTaintCheck On
        &lt;Location /cgi-bin/BackupPC/BackupPC_Admin&gt;   # &lt;--- change path as needed
           SetHandler perl-script
           PerlHandler Apache::Registry
           Options ExecCGI
           PerlSendHeader On
        &lt;/Location&gt;
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Apache 2.0.44 with Perl 5.8.0 on RedHat 7.1, Don Silvia reports that
this works (with tweaks from Michael Tuzi):</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so
    PerlModule Apache2</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    &lt;Directory /path/to/cgi/&gt;
        SetHandler perl-script

        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 192.168.0  
        AuthName &quot;Backup Admin&quot;
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile /path/to/user_file
        Require valid-user
    &lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>There are other optimizations and options with mod_perl.  For
example, you can tell mod_perl to preload various perl modules,
which saves memory compared to loading separate copies in every
Apache process after they are forked.  See Stas's definitive
mod_perl guide at <a href="http://perl.apache.org/guide">http://perl.apache.org/guide</a>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>BackupPC_Admin requires that users are authenticated by Apache.
Specifically, it expects that Apache sets the REMOTE_USER environment
variable when it runs.  There are several ways to do this.  One way
is to create a .htaccess file in the cgi-bin directory that looks like:</p>
<pre>
    AuthGroupFile /etc/httpd/conf/group    # &lt;--- change path as needed
    AuthUserFile /etc/http/conf/passwd     # &lt;--- change path as needed
    AuthType basic
    AuthName &quot;access&quot;
    require valid-user</pre>
<p>You will also need ``AllowOverride Indexes AuthConfig'' in the Apache
httpd.conf file to enable the .htaccess file. Alternatively, everything
can go in the Apache httpd.conf file inside a Location directive. The
list of users and password file above can be extracted from the NIS
passwd file.</p>
<p>One alternative is to use LDAP.  In Apache's http.conf add these lines:</p>
<pre>
    LoadModule auth_ldap_module   modules/auth_ldap.so
    AddModule auth_ldap.c</pre>
<pre>
    # cgi-bin - auth via LDAP (for BackupPC)
    &lt;Location /cgi-binBackupPC/BackupPC_Admin&gt;    # &lt;--- change path as needed
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName &quot;BackupPC login&quot;
      # replace MYDOMAIN, PORT, ORG and CO as needed
      AuthLDAPURL ldap://ldap.MYDOMAIN.com:PORT/o=ORG,c=CO?uid?sub?(objectClass=*)
      require valid-user
    &lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
<p>If you want to disable the user authentication you can set
<a href="#item__conf_cgiadminusers_">$Conf{CgiAdminUsers}</A> to '*', which allows any user to have
full access to all hosts and backups.  In this case the REMOTE_USER
environment variable does not have to be set by Apache.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can force a particular user name by getting Apache
to set REMOTE_USER, eg, to hardcode the user to www you could add
this to Apache's httpd.conf:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;Location /cgi-bin/BackupPC/BackupPC_Admin&gt;   # &lt;--- change path as needed
        Setenv REMOTE_USER www
    &lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
<p>Finally, you should also edit the config.pl file and adjust, as necessary,
the CGI-specific settings.  They're near the end of the config file. In
particular, you should specify which users or groups have administrator
(privileged) access: see the config settings <a href="#item__conf_cgiadminusergroup_">$Conf{CgiAdminUserGroup}</A>
and <a href="#item__conf_cgiadminusers_">$Conf{CgiAdminUsers}</A>.  Also, the configure.pl script placed various
images into <a href="#item__conf_cgiimagedir_">$Conf{CgiImageDir}</A> that BackupPC_Admin needs to serve
up.  You should make sure that <a href="#item__conf_cgiimagedirurl_">$Conf{CgiImageDirURL}</A> is the correct
URL for the image directory.</p>

<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="how_backuppc_finds_hosts">How BackupPC Finds Hosts</a></h2>
<p>Starting with v2.0.0 the way hosts are discovered has changed.  In most
cases you should specify 0 for the DHCP flag in the conf/hosts file,
even if the host has a dynamically assigned IP address.</p>
<p>BackupPC (starting with v2.0.0) looks up hosts with DHCP = 0 in this manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First DNS is used to lookup the IP address given the client's name
using perl's <code>gethostbyname()</code> function.  This should succeed for machines
that have fixed IP addresses that are known via DNS.  You can manually
see whether a given host have a DNS entry according to perls'
gethostbyname function with this command:</p>
<pre>
    perl -e 'print(gethostbyname(&quot;myhost&quot;) ? &quot;ok\n&quot; : &quot;not found\n&quot;);'</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>gethostbyname()</code> fails, BackupPC then attempts a NetBios multicast to
find the host.  Provided your client machine is configured properly,
it should respond to this NetBios multicast request.  Specifically,
BackupPC runs a command of this form:</p>
<pre>
    nmblookup myhost</pre>
<p>If this fails you will see output like:</p>
<pre>
    querying myhost on 10.10.255.255
    name_query failed to find name myhost</pre>
<p>If this success you will see output like:</p>
<pre>
    querying myhost on 10.10.255.255
    10.10.1.73 myhost&lt;00&gt;</pre>
<p>Depending on your netmask you might need to specify the -B option to
nmblookup.  For example:</p>
<pre>
    nmblookup -B 10.10.1.255 myhost</pre>
<p>If necessary, experiment on the nmblookup command that will return the
IP address of the client given its name.  Then update
<a href="#item__conf_nmblookupfindhostcmd_">$Conf{NmbLookupFindHostCmd}</A> with any necessary options to nmblookup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For hosts that have the DHCP flag set to 1, these machines are
discovered as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A DHCP address pool (<a href="#item__conf_dhcpaddressranges_">$Conf{DHCPAddressRanges}</A>) needs to be specified.
BackupPC will check the NetBIOS name of each machine in the range using
a command of the form:</p>
<pre>
    nmblookup -A W.X.Y.Z</pre>
<p>where W.X.Y.Z is each candidate address from <a href="#item__conf_dhcpaddressranges_">$Conf{DHCPAddressRanges}</A>.
Any host that has a valid NetBIOS name returned by this command (ie:
matching an entry in the hosts file) will be backed up.  You can
modify the specific nmblookup command if necessary via <a href="#item__conf_nmblookupcmd_">$Conf{NmbLookupCmd}</A>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You only need to use this DHCP feature if your client machine doesn't
respond to the NetBios multicast request:</p>
<pre>
    nmblookup myHost</pre>
<p>but does respond to a request directed to its IP address:</p>
<pre>
    nmblookup -A W.X.Y.Z</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<dt><strong><a name="item_removing_a_client">Removing a client</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If there is a machine that no longer needs to be backed up (eg: a retired
machine) you have two choices.  First, you can keep the backups accessible
and browsable, but disable all new backups.  Alternatively, you can
completely remove the client and all its backups.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>To disable backups for a client there are two special values for
<a href="#item__conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</A> in that client's per-PC config.pl file:</p>
</dd>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d1">-1</a></strong>

<p>Don't do any regular backups on this machine.  Manually
requested backups (via the CGI interface) will still occur.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d2">-2</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Don't do any backups on this machine.  Manually requested
backups (via the CGI interface) will be ignored.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>This will still allow that client's old backups to be browsable
and restorable.</p>
<p>To completely remove a client and all its backups, you should remove its
entry in the conf/hosts file, and then delete the __TOPDIR__/pc/$host
directory.  Whenever you change the hosts file, you should send
BackupPC a HUP (-1) signal so that it re-reads the hosts file.
If you don't do this, BackupPC will automatically re-read the
hosts file at the next regular wakeup.</p>
<p>Note that when you remove a client's backups you won't initially recover
a lot of disk space.  That's because the client's files are still in
the pool.  Overnight, when BackupPC_nightly next runs, all the unused
pool files will be deleted and this will recover the disk space used
by the client's backups.</p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_copying_the_pool">Copying the pool</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If the pool disk requirements grow you might need to copy the entire
data directory to a new (bigger) file system.  Hopefully you are lucky
enough to avoid this by having the data directory on a RAID file system
or LVM that allows the capacity to be grown in place by adding disks.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The backup data directories contain large numbers of hardlinks.  If
you try to copy the pool the target directory will occupy a lot more
space if the hardlinks aren't re-established.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The best way to copy a pool file system, if possible, is by copying
the raw device at the block level (eg: using dd).  Application level
programs that understand hardlinks include the GNU cp program with
the -a option and rsync -H.  However, the large number of hardlinks
in the pool will make the memory usage large and the copy very slow.
Don't forget to stop BackupPC while the copy runs.</p>

<h1><a name="restore_functions">Restore functions</a></h1>
<p>BackupPC supports several different methods for restoring files. The
most convenient restore options are provided via the CGI interface.
Alternatively, backup files can be restored using manual commands.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="cgi_restore_options">CGI restore options</a></h2>
<p>By selecting a host in the CGI interface, a list of all the backups
for that machine will be displayed.  By selecting the backup number
you can navigate the shares and directory tree for that backup.</p>
<p>BackupPC's CGI interface automatically fills incremental backups
with the corresponding full backup, which means each backup has
a filled appearance.  Therefore, there is no need to do multiple
restores from the incremental and full backups: BackupPC does all
the hard work for you.  You simply select the files and directories
you want from the correct backup vintage in one step.</p>
<p>You can download a single backup file at any time simply by selecting
it.  Your browser should prompt you with the file name and ask you
whether to open the file or save it to disk.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can select one or more files or directories in
the currently selected directory and select ``Restore selected files''.
(If you need to restore selected files and directories from several
different parent directories you will need to do that in multiple
steps.)</p>
<p>If you select all the files in a directory, BackupPC will replace
the list of files with the parent directory.  You will be presented
with a screen that has three options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_option_1_3a_direct_restore">Option 1: Direct Restore</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>With this option the selected files and directories are restored
directly back onto the host, by default in their original location.
Any old files with the same name will be overwritten, so use caution.
You can optionally change the target host name, target share name,
and target path prefix for the restore, allowing you to restore the
files to a different location.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Once you select ``Start Restore'' you will be prompted one last time
with a summary of the exact source and target files and directories
before you commit.  When you give the final go ahead the restore
operation will be queued like a normal backup job, meaning that it
will be deferred if there is a backup currently running for that host.
When the restore job is run, smbclient, tar, rsync or rsyncd is used
(depending upon <a href="#item__conf_xfermethod_">$Conf{XferMethod}</A>) to actually restore the files.
Sorry, there is currently no option to cancel a restore that has been
started.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>A record of the restore request, including the result and list of
files and directories, is kept.  It can be browsed from the host's

<h1><a name="archive_functions">Archive functions</a></h1>
<p>BackupPC supports archiving to removable media. For users that require
offsite backups, BackupPC can create archives that stream to tape
devices, or create files of specified sizes to fit onto cd or dvd media.</p>
<p>Each archive type is specified by a BackupPC host with its XferMethod
set to 'archive'. This allows for multiple configurations at sites where
there might be a combination of tape and cd/dvd backups being made.</p>
<p>BackupPC provides a menu that allows one or more hosts to be archived.
The most recent backup of each host is archived using BackupPC_tarCreate,
and the output is optionally compressed and split into fixed-sized
files (eg: 650MB).</p>
<p>The archive for each host is done by default using
__INSTALLDIR__/BackupPC_archiveHost.  This script can be copied
and customized as needed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="configuring_an_archive_host">Configuring an Archive Host</a></h2>
<p>To create an Archive Host, add it to the hosts file just as any other host
and call it a name that best describes the type of archive, e.g. ArchiveDLT</p>
<p>To tell BackupPC that the Host is for Archives, create a config.pl file in 
the Archive Hosts's pc directory, adding the following line:</p>
<p><a href="#item__conf_xfermethod_">$Conf{XferMethod}</A> = 'archive';</p>
<p>To further customise the archive's parameters you can adding the changed
parameters in the host's config.pl file. The parameters are explained in
the config.pl file.  Parameters may be fixed or the user can be allowed 
to change them (eg: output device).</p>
<p>The per-host archive command is <a href="#item__conf_archiveclientcmd_">$Conf{ArchiveClientCmd}</A>.  By default
this invokes</p>
<pre>
     __INSTALLDIR__/BackupPC_archiveHost</pre>
<p>which you can copy and customize as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="starting_an_archive">Starting an Archive</a></h2>
<p>In the web interface, click on the Archive Host you wish to use. You will see a
list of previous archives and a summary on each. By clicking the ``Start Archive''
button you are presented with the list of hosts and the approximate backup size
(note this is raw size, not projected compressed size) Select the hosts you wish
to archive and press the ``Archive Selected Hosts'' button.</p>
<p>The next screen allows you to adjust the parameters for this archive run.
Press the ``Start the Archive'' to start archiving the selected hosts with the
parameters displayed.</p>

<h2><a name="configuration_and_host_editor">Configuration and Host Editor</a></h2>
<p>The CGI interface has a complete configuration and host editor.
Only the administrator can edit the main configuration settings
and hosts.  The edit links are in the left navigation bar.</p>
<p>When changes are made to any parameter a ``Save'' button appears
at the top of the page.  If you are editing a text box you will
need to click outside of the text box to make the Save button
appear.  If you don't select Save then the changes won't be saved.</p>
<p>The host-specific configuration can be edited from the host
summary page using the link in the left navigation bar.
The administrator can edit any of the host-specific
configuration settings.</p>
<p>When editing the host-specific configuration, each parameter has
an ``override'' setting that denotes the value is host-specific,
meaning that it overrides the setting in the main configuration.
If you unselect ``override'' then the setting is removed from
the host-specific configuration, and the main configuration
file is displayed.</p>
<p>User's can edit their host-specific configuration if enabled
via <a href="#item__conf_cgiuserconfigeditenable_">$Conf{CgiUserConfigEditEnable}</A>.  The specific subset
of configuration settings that a user can edit is specified
with <a href="#item__conf_cgiuserconfigedit_">$Conf{CgiUserConfigEdit}</A>.  It is recommended to make this
list short as possible (you probably don't want your users saving

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_pooling_common_files">Pooling common files</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>To quickly see if a file is already in the pool, an MD5 digest of the
file length and contents is used as the file name in the pool. This
can't guarantee a file is identical: it just reduces the search to
often a single file or handful of files. A complete file comparison
is always done to verify if two files are really the same.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Identical files on multiples backups are represented by hard links.
Hardlinks are used so that identical files all refer to the same
physical file on the server's disk. Also, hard links maintain
reference counts so that BackupPC knows when to delete unused files
from the pool.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For the computer-science majors among you, you can think of the pooling
system used by BackupPC as just a chained hash table stored on a (big)
file system.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_the_hashing_function">The hashing function</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>There is a tradeoff between how much of file is used for the MD5 digest
and the time taken comparing all the files that have the same hash.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Using the file length and just the first 4096 bytes of the file for the
MD5 digest produces some repetitions.  One example: with 900,000 unique
files in the pool, this hash gives about 7,000 repeated files, and in
the worst case 500 files have the same hash.  That's not bad: we only
have to do a single file compare 99.2% of the time.  But in the worst
case we have to compare as many as 500 files checking for a match.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>With a modest increase in CPU time, if we use the file length and the
first 256K of the file we now only have 500 repeated files and in the
worst case around 20 files have the same hash. Furthermore, if we
instead use the first and last 128K of the file (more specifically, the
first and eighth 128K chunks for files larger than 1MB) we get only 300
repeated files and in the worst case around 20 files have the same hash.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Based on this experimentation, this is the hash function used by BackupPC.
It is important that you don't change the hash function after files
are already in the pool.  Otherwise your pool will grow to twice the
size until all the old backups (and all the old files with old hashes)
eventually expire.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_compression">Compression</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>BackupPC supports compression. It uses the deflate and inflate methods
in the Compress::Zlib module, which is based on the zlib compression
library (see <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The <a href="#item__conf_compresslevel_">$Conf{CompressLevel}</A> setting specifies the compression level to use.
Zero (0) means no compression. Compression levels can be from 1 (least
cpu time, slightly worse compression) to 9 (most cpu time, slightly
better compression). The recommended value is 3. Changing it to 5, for
example, will take maybe 20% more cpu time and will get another 2-3%
additional compression. Diminishing returns set in above 5.  See the zlib
documentation for more information about compression levels.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>BackupPC implements compression with minimal CPU load. Rather than
compressing every incoming backup file and then trying to match it
against the pool, BackupPC computes the MD5 digest based on the
uncompressed file, and matches against the candidate pool files by
comparing each uncompressed pool file against the incoming backup file.
Since inflating a file takes roughly a factor of 10 less CPU time than
deflating there is a big saving in CPU time.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The combination of pooling common files and compression can yield
a factor of 8 or more overall saving in backup storage.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="backuppc_operation">BackupPC operation</a></h2>
<p>BackupPC reads the configuration information from
__CONFDIR__/config.pl. It then runs and manages all the backup
activity. It maintains queues of pending backup requests, user backup
requests and administrative commands. Based on the configuration various
requests will be executed simultaneously.</p>
<p>As specified by <a href="#item__conf_wakeupschedule_">$Conf{WakeupSchedule}</A>, BackupPC wakes up periodically
to queue backups on all the PCs.  This is a four step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For each host and DHCP address backup requests are queued on the
background command queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each PC, BackupPC_dump is forked. Several of these may be run in
parallel, based on the configuration. First a ping is done to see if
the machine is alive. If this is a DHCP address, nmblookup is run to
get the netbios name, which is used as the host name. If DNS lookup
fails, <a href="#item__conf_nmblookupfindhostcmd_">$Conf{NmbLookupFindHostCmd}</A> is run to find the IP address from
the host name.  The file __TOPDIR__/pc/$host/backups is read to decide
whether a full or incremental backup needs to be run. If no backup is
scheduled, or the ping to $host fails, then BackupPC_dump exits.</p>
<p>The backup is done using the specified XferMethod.  Either samba's smbclient
or tar over ssh/rsh/nfs piped into BackupPC_tarExtract, or rsync over ssh/rsh
is run, or rsyncd is connected to, with the incoming data
extracted to __TOPDIR__/pc/$host/new.  The XferMethod output is put
into __TOPDIR__/pc/$host/XferLOG.</p>
<p>The letter in the XferLOG file shows the type of object, similar to the
first letter of the modes displayed by ls -l:</p>
<pre>
    d -&gt; directory
    l -&gt; symbolic link
    b -&gt; block special file
    c -&gt; character special file
    p -&gt; pipe file (fifo)
    nothing -&gt; regular file</pre>
<p>The words mean:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_create">create</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>new for this backup (ie: directory or file not in pool)</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_pool">pool</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>found a match in the pool</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_same">same</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>file is identical to previous backup (contents were
checksummed and verified during full dump).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_skip">skip</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>file skipped in incremental because attributes are the
same (only displayed if <a href="#item__conf_xferloglevel_">$Conf{XferLogLevel}</A> &gt;= 2).</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>As BackupPC_tarExtract extracts the files from smbclient or tar, or as
rsync runs, it checks each file in the backup to see if it is identical
to an existing file from any previous backup of any PC. It does this
without needed to write the file to disk. If the file matches an
existing file, a hardlink is created to the existing file in the pool.
If the file does not match any existing files, the file is written to
disk and the file name is saved in __TOPDIR__/pc/$host/NewFileList for
later processing by BackupPC_link.  BackupPC_tarExtract and rsync can handle
arbitrarily large files and multiple candidate matching files without
needing to write the file to disk in the case of a match.  This
significantly reduces disk writes (and also reads, since the pool file
comparison is done disk to memory, rather than disk to disk).</p>
<p>Based on the configuration settings, BackupPC_dump checks each
old backup to see if any should be removed.  Any expired backups
are moved to __TOPDIR__/trash for later removal by BackupPC_trashClean.</p>
<li>
<p>For each complete, good, backup, BackupPC_link is run.
To avoid race conditions as new files are linked into the
pool area, only a single BackupPC_link program runs
at a time and the rest are queued.</p>
<p>BackupPC_link reads the NewFileList written by BackupPC_dump and
inspects each new file in the backup. It re-checks if there is a
matching file in the pool (another BackupPC_link
could have added the file since BackupPC_dump checked). If so, the file
is removed and replaced by a hard link to the existing file. If the file
is new, a hard link to the file is made in the pool area, so that this
file is available for checking against each new file and new backup.</p>
<p>Then, if <a href="#item__conf_incrfill_">$Conf{IncrFill}</A> is set (note that the default setting is
off), for each incremental backup, hard links are made in the new
backup to all files that were not extracted during the incremental
backups.  The means the incremental backup looks like a complete
image of the PC (with the exception that files that were removed on
the PC since the last full backup will still appear in the backup
directory tree).</p>
<p>The CGI interface knows how to merge unfilled incremental backups will
the most recent prior filled (full) backup, giving the incremental
backups a filled appearance.  The default for <a href="#item__conf_incrfill_">$Conf{IncrFill}</A> is off,
since there is no need to fill incremental backups.  This saves
some level of disk activity, since lots of extra hardlinks are no
longer needed (and don't have to be deleted when the backup expires).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BackupPC_trashClean is always run in the background to remove any
expired backups. Every 5 minutes it wakes up and removes all the files
in __TOPDIR__/trash.</p>
<p>Also, once each night, BackupPC_nightly is run to complete some
additional administrative tasks, such as cleaning the pool.  This
involves removing any files in the pool that only have a single
hard link (meaning no backups are using that file).  Again, to
avoid race conditions, BackupPC_nightly is only run when there
are no BackupPC_link processes running.  When BackupPC_nightly is
run no new BackupPC_link jobs are started.  If BackupPC_nightly
takes too long to run, the settings <a href="#item__conf_maxbackuppcnightlyjobs_">$Conf{MaxBackupPCNightlyJobs}</A>
and <a href="#item__conf_backuppcnightlyperiod_">$Conf{BackupPCNightlyPeriod}</A> can be used to run several
BackupPC_nightly processes in parallel, and to split its job over
several nights.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>BackupPC also listens for TCP connections on <a href="#item__conf_serverport_">$Conf{ServerPort}</A>, which
is used by the CGI script BackupPC_Admin for status reporting and
user-initiated backup or backup cancel requests.</p>

old backup expires, BackupPC_dump simply moves the directory to
__TOPDIR__/trash for later removal by BackupPC_trashClean.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item___topdir___2fpool">__TOPDIR__/pool</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>All uncompressed files from PC backups are stored below __TOPDIR__/pool.
Each file's name is based on the MD5 hex digest of the file contents.
Specifically, for files less than 256K, the file length and the entire
file is used. For files up to 1MB, the file length and the first and
last 128K are used. Finally, for files longer than 1MB, the file length,
and the first and eighth 128K chunks for the file are used.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Each file is stored in a subdirectory X/Y/Z, where X, Y, Z are the
first 3 hex digits of the MD5 digest.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For example, if a file has an MD5 digest of 123456789abcdef0,
the file is stored in __TOPDIR__/pool/1/2/3/123456789abcdef0.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The MD5 digest might not be unique (especially since not all the file's
contents are used for files bigger than 256K). Different files that have
the same MD5 digest are stored with a trailing suffix ``_n'' where n is
an incrementing number starting at 0. So, for example, if two additional
files were identical to the first, except the last byte was different,
and assuming the file was larger than 1MB (so the MD5 digests are the
same but the files are actually different), the three files would be
stored as:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
        __TOPDIR__/pool/1/2/3/123456789abcdef0
        __TOPDIR__/pool/1/2/3/123456789abcdef0_0
        __TOPDIR__/pool/1/2/3/123456789abcdef0_1</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Both BackupPC_dump (actually, BackupPC_tarExtract) and BackupPC_link are
responsible for checking newly backed up files against the pool. For
each file, the MD5 digest is used to generate a file name in the pool
directory. If the file exists in the pool, the contents are compared.
If there is no match, additional files ending in ``_n'' are checked.
(Actually, BackupPC_tarExtract compares multiple candidate files in
parallel.)  If the file contents exactly match, the file is created by
simply making a hard link to the pool file (this is done by
BackupPC_tarExtract as the backup proceeds). Otherwise,
BackupPC_tarExtract writes the new file to disk and a new hard link is
made in the pool to the file (this is done later by BackupPC_link).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Therefore, every file in the pool will have at least 2 hard links
(one for the pool file and one for the backup file below __TOPDIR__/pc).
Identical files from different backups or PCs will all be linked to
the same file.  When old backups are deleted, some files in the pool
might only have one link.  BackupPC_nightly checks the entire pool
and removes all files that have only a single link, thereby recovering
the storage for that file.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>One other issue: zero length files are not pooled, since there are a lot
of these files and on most file systems it doesn't save any disk space
to turn these files into hard links.</p>

<h2><a name="compressed_file_format">Compressed file format</a></h2>
<p>The compressed file format is as generated by Compress::Zlib::deflate
with one minor, but important, tweak. Since Compress::Zlib::inflate
fully inflates its argument in memory, it could take large amounts of
memory if it was inflating a highly compressed file. For example, a
200MB file of 0x0 bytes compresses to around 200K bytes. If
Compress::Zlib::inflate was called with this single 200K buffer, it
would need to allocate 200MB of memory to return the result.</p>
<p>BackupPC watches how efficiently a file is compressing. If a big file
has very high compression (meaning it will use too much memory when it
is inflated), BackupPC calls the <code>flush()</code> method, which gracefully
completes the current compression.  BackupPC then starts another
deflate and simply appends the output file.  So the BackupPC compressed
file format is one or more concatenated deflations/flushes.  The specific
ratios that BackupPC uses is that if a 6MB chunk compresses to less
than 64K then a flush will be done.</p>
<p>Back to the example of the 200MB file of 0x0 bytes.  Adding flushes
every 6MB adds only 200 or so bytes to the 200K output.  So the
storage cost of flushing is negligible.</p>
<p>To easily decompress a BackupPC compressed file, the script
BackupPC_zcat can be found in __INSTALLDIR__/bin.  For each
file name argument it inflates the file and writes it to stdout.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="rsync_checksum_caching">Rsync checksum caching</a></h2>
<p>An incremental backup with rsync compares attributes on the client
with the last full backup.  Any files with identical attributes
are skipped.  A full backup with rsync sets the --ignore-times
option, which causes every file to be examined independent of
attributes.</p>
<p>Each file is examined by generating block checksums (default 2K
blocks) on the receiving side (that's the BackupPC side), sending
those checksums to the client, where the remote rsync matches those
checksums with the corresponding file.  The matching blocks and new
data is sent back, allowing the client file to be reassembled.
A checksum for the entire file is sent to as an extra check the
the reconstructed file is correct.</p>
<p>This results in significant disk IO and computation for BackupPC:
every file in a full backup, or any file with non-matching attributes
in an incremental backup, needs to be uncompressed, block checksums
computed and sent.  Then the receiving side reassembles the file and
has to verify the whole-file checksum.  Even if the file is identical,
prior to 2.1.0, BackupPC had to read and uncompress the file twice,
once to compute the block checksums and later to verify the whole-file
checksum.</p>
<p>Starting in 2.1.0, BackupPC supports optional checksum caching,
which means the block and file checksums only need to be computed
once for each file.  This results in a significant performance
improvement.  This only works for compressed pool files.
It is enabled by adding</p>
<pre>
        '--checksum-seed=32761',</pre>
<p>to <a href="#item__conf_rsyncargs_">$Conf{RsyncArgs}</A> and <a href="#item__conf_rsyncrestoreargs_">$Conf{RsyncRestoreArgs}</A>.</p>
<p>Rsync versions prior to and including rsync-2.6.2 need a small patch to
add support for the --checksum-seed option.  This patch is available in
the cygwin-rsyncd package at <a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net">http://backuppc.sourceforge.net</a>.
This patch is already included in rsync CVS, so it will be standard
in future versions of rsync.</p>
<p>When this option is present, BackupPC will add block and file checksums
to the compressed pool file the next time a pool file is used and it
doesn't already have cached checksums.  The first time a new file is
written to the pool, the checksums are not appended.  The next time
checksums are needed for a file, they are computed and added.  So the
full performance benefit of checksum caching won't be noticed until the
third time a pool file is used (eg: the third full backup).</p>
<p>With checksum caching enabled, there is a risk that should a file's contents
in the pool be corrupted due to a disk problem, but the cached checksums
are still correct, the corruption will not be detected by a full backup,
since the file contents are no longer read and compared.  To reduce the
chance that this remains undetected, BackupPC can recheck cached checksums
for a fraction of the files.  This fraction is set with the
<a href="#item__conf_rsynccsumcacheverifyprob_">$Conf{RsyncCsumCacheVerifyProb}</A> setting.  The default value of 0.01 means
that 1% of the time a file's checksums are read, the checksums are verified.
This reduces performance slightly, but, over time, ensures that files
contents are in sync with the cached checksums.</p>
<p>The format of the cached checksum data can be discovered by looking at
the code.  Basically, the first byte of the compressed file is changed
to denote that checksums are appended.  The block and file checksum
data, plus some other information and magic word, are appended to the
compressed file.  This allows the cache update to be done in-place.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="file_name_mangling">File name mangling</a></h2>
<p>Backup file names are stored in ``mangled'' form. Each node of
a path is preceded by ``f'' (mnemonic: file), and special characters
(\n, \r, % and /) are URI-encoded as ``%xx'', where xx is the ascii
character's hex value.  So c:/craig/example.txt is now stored as
fc/fcraig/fexample.txt.</p>
<p>This was done mainly so meta-data could be stored alongside the backup
files without name collisions. In particular, the attributes for the
files in a directory are stored in a file called ``attrib'', and mangling
avoids file name collisions (I discarded the idea of having a duplicate
directory tree for every backup just to store the attributes). Other
meta-data (eg: rsync checksums) could be stored in file names preceded
by, eg, ``c''. There are two other benefits to mangling: the share name
might contain ``/'' (eg: ``/home/craig'' for tar transport), and I wanted
that represented as a single level in the storage tree. Secondly, as
files are written to NewFileList for later processing by BackupPC_link,
embedded newlines in the file's path will cause problems which are
avoided by mangling.</p>
<p>The CGI script undoes the mangling, so it is invisible to the user.
Old (unmangled) backups are still supported by the CGI
interface.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="special_files">Special files</a></h2>
<p>Linux/unix file systems support several special file types: symbolic
links, character and block device files, fifos (pipes) and unix-domain
sockets. All except unix-domain sockets are supported by BackupPC
(there's no point in backing up or restoring unix-domain sockets since
they only have meaning after a process creates them). Symbolic links are
stored as a plain file whose contents are the contents of the link (not
the file it points to). This file is compressed and pooled like any
normal file. Character and block device files are also stored as plain
files, whose contents are two integers separated by a comma; the numbers
are the major and minor device number. These files are compressed and
pooled like any normal file. Fifo files are stored as empty plain files
(which are not pooled since they have zero size). In all cases, the
original file type is stored in the attrib file so it can be correctly
restored.</p>
<p>Hardlinks are also supported.  When GNU tar first encounters a file with
more than one link (ie: hardlinks) it dumps it as a regular file.  When
it sees the second and subsequent hardlinks to the same file, it dumps
just the hardlink information.  BackupPC correctly recognizes these
hardlinks and stores them just like symlinks: a regular text file
whose contents is the path of the file linked to.  The CGI script
will download the original file when you click on a hardlink.</p>
<p>Also, BackupPC_tarCreate has enough magic to re-create the hardlinks
dynamically based on whether or not the original file and hardlinks
are both included in the tar file.  For example, imagine a/b/x is a
hardlink to a/c/y.  If you use BackupPC_tarCreate to restore directory
a, then the tar file will include a/b/x as the original file and a/c/y
will be a hardlink to a/b/x.  If, instead you restore a/c, then the
tar file will include a/c/y as the original file, not a hardlink.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="attribute_file_format">Attribute file format</a></h2>
<p>The unix attributes for the contents of a directory (all the files and
directories in that directory) are stored in a file called attrib.
There is a single attrib file for each directory in a backup.
For example, if c:/craig contains a single file c:/craig/example.txt,
that file would be stored as fc/fcraig/fexample.txt and there would be an
attribute file in fc/fcraig/attrib (and also fc/attrib and ./attrib).
The file fc/fcraig/attrib would contain a single entry containing the
attributes for fc/fcraig/fexample.txt.</p>
<p>The attrib file starts with a magic number, followed by the
concatenation of the following information for each file:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>File name length in perl's pack ``w'' format (variable length base 128).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unix file type, mode, uid, gid and file size divided by 4GB and
file size modulo 4GB (type mode uid gid sizeDiv4GB sizeMod4GB),
in perl's pack ``w'' format (variable length base 128).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unix mtime (unix seconds) in perl's pack ``N'' format (32 bit integer).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The attrib file is also compressed if compression is enabled.
See the lib/BackupPC/Attrib.pm module for full details.</p>
<p>Attribute files are pooled just like normal backup files.  This saves
space if all the files in a directory have the same attributes across
multiple backups, which is common.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="optimizations">Optimizations</a></h2>
<p>BackupPC doesn't care about the access time of files in the pool
since it saves attribute meta-data separate from the files.  Since
BackupPC mostly does reads from disk, maintaining the access time of
files generates a lot of unnecessary disk writes.  So, provided 
BackupPC has a dedicated data disk, you should consider mounting
BackupPC's data directory with the noatime attribute (see mount(1)).</p>

<h1><a name="configuration_file">Configuration File</a></h1>
<p>The BackupPC configuration file resides in __CONFDIR__/config.pl.
Optional per-PC configuration files reside in __CONFDIR__/pc/$host.pl
(or __TOPDIR__/pc/$host/config.pl in non-FHS versions of BackupPC).
This file can be used to override settings just for a particular PC.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="modifying_the_main_configuration_file">Modifying the main configuration file</a></h2>
<p>The configuration file is a perl script that is executed by BackupPC, so
you should be careful to preserve the file syntax (punctuation, quotes
etc) when you edit it. It is recommended that you use CVS, RCS or some
other method of source control for changing config.pl.</p>
<p>BackupPC reads or re-reads the main configuration file and
the hosts file in three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upon startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When BackupPC is sent a HUP (-1) signal.  Assuming you installed the 
init.d script, you can also do this with ``/etc/init.d/backuppc reload''.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the modification time of config.pl file changes.  BackupPC
checks the modification time once during each regular wakeup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you change the configuration file you can either do
a kill -HUP BackupPC_pid or simply wait until the next regular
wakeup period.</p>
<p>Each time the configuration file is re-read a message is reported in the
LOG file, so you can tail it (or view it via the CGI interface) to make
sure your kill -HUP worked. Errors in parsing the configuration file are
also reported in the LOG file.</p>
<p>The optional per-PC configuration file (__CONFDIR__/pc/$host.pl or
__TOPDIR__/pc/$host/config.pl in non-FHS versions of BackupPC)
is read whenever it is needed by BackupPC_dump, BackupPC_link and others.</p>

<h1><a name="configuration_parameters">Configuration Parameters</a></h1>
<p>The configuration parameters are divided into five general groups.
The first group (general server configuration) provides general
configuration for BackupPC.  The next two groups describe what to
backup, when to do it, and how long to keep it.  The fourth group
are settings for email reminders, and the final group contains
settings for the CGI interface.</p>
<p>All configuration settings in the second through fifth groups can
be overridden by the per-PC config.pl file.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="general_server_configuration">General server configuration</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_serverhost_">$Conf{ServerHost} = '';</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Host name on which the BackupPC server is running.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_serverport_">$Conf{ServerPort} = -1;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>TCP port number on which the BackupPC server listens for and accepts
connections.  Normally this should be disabled (set to -1).  The TCP
port is only needed if apache runs on a different machine from BackupPC.
In that case, set this to any spare port number over 1024 (eg: 2359).
If you enable the TCP port, make sure you set <a href="#item__conf_servermesgsecret_">$Conf{ServerMesgSecret}</A>
too!</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_servermesgsecret_">$Conf{ServerMesgSecret} = '';</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Shared secret to make the TCP port secure.  Set this to a hard to guess
string if you enable the TCP port (ie: <a href="#item__conf_serverport_">$Conf{ServerPort}</A> &gt; 0).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>To avoid possible attacks via the TCP socket interface, every client
message is protected by an MD5 digest. The MD5 digest includes four
items:
  - a seed that is sent to the client when the connection opens
  - a sequence number that increments for each message
  - a shared secret that is stored in <a href="#item__conf_servermesgsecret_">$Conf{ServerMesgSecret}</A>
  - the message itself.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The message is sent in plain text preceded by the MD5 digest.  A
snooper can see the plain-text seed sent by BackupPC and plain-text
message from the client, but cannot construct a valid MD5 digest since
the secret <a href="#item__conf_servermesgsecret_">$Conf{ServerMesgSecret}</A> is unknown.  A replay attack is
not possible since the seed changes on a per-connection and
per-message basis.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_mypath_">$Conf{MyPath} = '/bin';</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>PATH setting for BackupPC.  An explicit value is necessary
for taint mode.  Value shouldn't matter too much since
all execs use explicit paths.  However, taint mode in perl
will complain if this directory is world writable.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_umaskmode_">$Conf{UmaskMode} = 027;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Permission mask for directories and files created by BackupPC.
Default value prevents any access from group other, and prevents
group write.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_wakeupschedule_">$Conf{WakeupSchedule} = [1..23];</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Times at which we wake up, check all the PCs, and schedule necessary
backups.  Times are measured in hours since midnight.  Can be
fractional if necessary (eg: 4.25 means 4:15am).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If the hosts you are backing up are always connected to the network
you might have only one or two wakeups each night.  This will keep
the backup activity after hours.  On the other hand, if you are backing
up laptops that are only intermittently connected to the network you
will want to have frequent wakeups (eg: hourly) to maximize the chance
that each laptop is backed up.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Examples:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    <a href="#item__conf_wakeupschedule_">$Conf{WakeupSchedule}</A> = [22.5];         # once per day at 10:30 pm.

</dd>
<dd>
<p>The default value is every hour except midnight.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The first entry of <a href="#item__conf_wakeupschedule_">$Conf{WakeupSchedule}</A> is when BackupPC_nightly
is run.  No other backups can run while BackupPC_nightly is
running.  You might want to re-arrange the entries in
<a href="#item__conf_wakeupschedule_">$Conf{WakeupSchedule}</A> (they don't have to be ascending) so that
the first entry is when you want BackupPC_nightly to run
(eg: when you don't expect a lot of regular backups to run).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_maxbackups_">$Conf{MaxBackups} = 4;</a></strong>

of simultaneous backups.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_maxuserbackups_">$Conf{MaxUserBackups} = 4;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Additional number of simultaneous backups that users can run.
As many as <a href="#item__conf_maxbackups_">$Conf{MaxBackups}</A> + <a href="#item__conf_maxuserbackups_">$Conf{MaxUserBackups}</A> requests can
run at the same time.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_maxpendingcmds_">$Conf{MaxPendingCmds} = 10;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Maximum number of pending link commands. New backups will only be
started if there are no more than <a href="#item__conf_maxpendingcmds_">$Conf{MaxPendingCmds}</A> plus
<a href="#item__conf_maxbackups_">$Conf{MaxBackups}</A> number of pending link commands, plus running jobs.

</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_maxbackuppcnightlyjobs_">$Conf{MaxBackupPCNightlyJobs} = 2;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>How many BackupPC_nightly processes to run in parallel.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Each night, at the first wakeup listed in <a href="#item__conf_wakeupschedule_">$Conf{WakeupSchedule}</A>,
BackupPC_nightly is run.  Its job is to remove unneeded files
in the pool, ie: files that only have one link.  To avoid race
conditions, BackupPC_nightly runs only when there are no backups
running, and no backups will start while it runs.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>So to reduce the elapsed time, you might want to increase this
setting to run several BackupPC_nightly processes in parallel
(eg: 4, or even 8).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_backuppcnightlyperiod_">$Conf{BackupPCNightlyPeriod} = 1;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>How many days (runs) it takes BackupPC_nightly to traverse the
entire pool.  Normally this is 1, which means every night it runs,
it does traverse the entire pool removing unused pool files.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Other valid values are 2, 4, 8, 16.  This causes BackupPC_nightly to
traverse 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 or 1/16th of the pool each night, meaning it
takes 2, 4, 8 or 16 days to completely traverse the pool.  The
advantage is that each night the running time of BackupPC_nightly
is reduced roughly in proportion, since the total job is split
over multiple days.  The disadvantage is that unused pool files
take longer to get deleted, which will slightly increase disk
usage.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Note that even when <a href="#item__conf_backuppcnightlyperiod_">$Conf{BackupPCNightlyPeriod}</A> &gt; 1, BackupPC_nightly
still runs every night.  It just does less work each time it runs.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>Maximum number of log files we keep around in log directory.
These files are aged nightly.  A setting of 14 means the log
directory will contain about 2 weeks of old log files, in
particular at most the files LOG, LOG.0, LOG.1, ... LOG.13
(except today's LOG, these files will have a .z extension if
compression is on).</p>

<p>Maximum threshold for disk utilization on the __TOPDIR__ filesystem.
If the output from <a href="#item__conf_dfpath_">$Conf{DfPath}</A> reports a percentage larger than
this number then no new regularly scheduled backups will be run.

<p>Level of each incremental.  ``Level'' follows the terminology

of level N will backup all files that have changed since
the most recent backup of a lower level.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The entries of <a href="#item__conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</A> apply in order to each
incremental after each full backup.  It wraps around until
the next full backup.  For example, these two settings
have the same effect:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
      <a href="#item__conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</A> = [1, 2, 3];
      <a href="#item__conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</A> = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3];</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This means the 1st and 4th incrementals (level 1) go all
the way back to the full.  The 2nd and 3rd (and 5th and
6th) backups just go back to the immediate preceeding
incremental.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Specifying a sequence of multi-level incrementals will
usually mean more than <a href="#item__conf_incrkeepcnt_">$Conf{IncrKeepCnt}</A> incrementals will
need to be kept, since lower level incrementals are needed
to merge a complete view of a backup.  For example, with</p>
</dd>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>there will be up to 11 incrementals in this case:</p>

<dd>
<pre>
      backup #0  (full, level 0, oldest)
      backup #1  (incr, level 1)
      backup #2  (incr, level 2)

      backup #9  (incr, level 2)
      backup #10 (incr, level 3)
      backup #11 (incr, level 4)
      backup #12 (incr, level 5, newest)</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Backup #1 (the oldest level 1 incremental) can't be deleted
since backups 2..6 depend on it.  Those 6 incrementals can't
all be deleted since that would only leave 5 (#8..12).
When the next incremental happens (level 6), the complete
set of 6 older incrementals (#1..6) will be deleted, since
that maintains the required number (<a href="#item__conf_incrkeepcnt_">$Conf{IncrKeepCnt}</A>)
of incrementals.  This situation is reduced if you set
shorter chains of multi-level incrementals, eg:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
      <a href="#item__conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</A>  = [1, 2, 3];</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>would only have up to 2 extra incremenals before all 3
are deleted.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>BackupPC as usual merges the full and the sequence
of incrementals together so each incremental can be
browsed and restored as though it is a complete backup.
If you specify a long chain of incrementals then more
backups need to be merged when browsing, restoring,
or getting the starting point for rsync backups.
In the example above (levels 1..6), browing backup
#6 requires 7 different backups (#0..6) to be merged.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Because of this merging and the additional incrementals
that need to be kept, it is recommended that some
level 1 incrementals be included in <a href="#item__conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</A>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Prior to version 3.0 incrementals were always level 1,

<dd>
<p>A failed full backup is saved as a partial backup.  The rsync
XferMethod can take advantage of the partial full when the next
backup is run. This parameter sets the age of the partial full
in days: if the partial backup is older than this number of
days, then rsync will ignore (not use) the partial full when
the next backup is run.  If you set this to a negative value
then no partials will be saved.  If you set this to 0, partials
will be saved, but will not be used by the next backup.</p>
</dd>

full dump.  Prior to v1.03 all incremental backups were filled.
In v1.4.0 and later the default is off.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>BackupPC, and the cgi interface in particular, do the right thing on
un-filled incremental backups.  It will correctly display the merged
incremental backup with the most recent filled backup, giving the
un-filled incremental backups a filled appearance.  That means it
invisible to the user whether incremental dumps are filled or not.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Filling backups takes a little extra disk space, and it does cost
some extra disk activity for filling, and later removal.  Filling
is no longer useful, since file mangling and compression doesn't
make a filled backup very useful. It's likely the filling option
will be removed from future versions: filling will be delegated to
the display and extraction of backup data.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If filling is off, BackupPC makes sure that the oldest backup is

<dd>
<p>PCs that are always or often on the network can be backed up after
hours, to reduce PC, network and server load during working hours. For
each PC a count of consecutive good pings is maintained. Once a PC has
at least <a href="#item__conf_blackoutgoodcnt_">$Conf{BlackoutGoodCnt}</A> consecutive good pings it is subject
to ``blackout'' and not backed up during hours and days specified by

machine is always on the network, it will only be pinged roughly once
every <a href="#item__conf_incrperiod_">$Conf{IncrPeriod}</A> (eg: once per day). So a setting for
<a href="#item__conf_blackoutgoodcnt_">$Conf{BlackoutGoodCnt}</A> of 7 means it will take around 7 days for a
machine to be subject to blackout. On the other hand, if a ping is
failed, it will be retried roughly every time BackupPC wakes up, eg,
every one or two hours. So a setting for <a href="#item__conf_blackoutbadpinglimit_">$Conf{BlackoutBadPingLimit}</A> of
3 means that the PC will lose its blackout status after 3-6 hours of
unavailability.</p>

<p>Note that GNU tar has several methods for specifying incremental backups,
including:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  --newer-mtime $incrDate+
         This causes a file to be included if the modification time is
         later than $incrDate (meaning its contents might have changed).
         But changes in the ownership or modes will not qualify the
         file to be included in an incremental.</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  --newer=$incrDate+
         This causes the file to be included if any attribute of the
         file is later than $incrDate, meaning either attributes or
         the modification time.  This is the default method.  Do
         not use --atime-preserve in <a href="#item__conf_tarclientcmd_">$Conf{TarClientCmd}</A> above,
         otherwise resetting the atime (access time) counts as an

</dd>
<dd>

  $nmbLookupPath      path to nmblookup (<a href="#item__conf_nmblookuppath_">$Conf{NmbLookupPath}</A>)
  $host               NetBios name</pre>

<p>In some cases you might need to change the broadcast address, for
example if nmblookup uses 192.168.255.255 by default and you find
that doesn't work, try 192.168.1.255 (or your equivalent class C
address) using the -B option:</p>

<p>For fixed IP address hosts, BackupPC_dump can also verify the netbios
name to ensure it matches the host name.  An error is generated if
they do not match.  Typically this flag is off.  But if you are going

setting this flag is a great way to verify that the machines have
their netbios name set correctly before turning on DCHP.</p>

<p>Wade Brown reports that on solaris 2.6 and 2.7 ping -s returns the wrong

</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_pingmaxmsec_">$Conf{PingMaxMsec} = 20;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Maximum round-trip ping time in milliseconds.  This threshold is set
to avoid backing up PCs that are remotely connected through WAN or
dialup connections.  The output from ping -s (assuming it is supported
on your system) is used to check the round-trip packet time.  On your
local LAN round-trip times should be much less than 20msec.  On most
WAN or dialup connections the round-trip time will be typically more
than 20msec.  Tune if necessary.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_compresslevel_">$Conf{CompressLevel} = 0;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Compression level to use on files.  0 means no compression.  Compression
levels can be from 1 (least cpu time, slightly worse compression) to
9 (most cpu time, slightly better compression).  The recommended value
is 3.  Changing to 5, for example, will take maybe 20% more cpu time
and will get another 2-3% additional compression. See the zlib
documentation for more information about compression levels.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Changing compression on or off after backups have already been done
will require both compressed and uncompressed pool files to be stored.
This will increase the pool storage requirements, at least until all
the old backups expire and are deleted.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>It is ok to change the compression value (from one non-zero value to
another non-zero value) after dumps are already done.  Since BackupPC
matches pool files by comparing the uncompressed versions, it will still
correctly match new incoming files against existing pool files.  The
new compression level will take effect only for new files that are
newly compressed and added to the pool.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If compression was off and you are enabling compression for the first
time you can use the BackupPC_compressPool utility to compress the
pool.  This avoids having the pool grow to accommodate both compressed
and uncompressed backups.  See the documentation for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Note: compression needs the Compress::Zlib perl library.  If the
Compress::Zlib library can't be found then <a href="#item__conf_compresslevel_">$Conf{CompressLevel}</A> is
forced to 0 (compression off).</p>

and the backup is terminated.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Note that stdout buffering combined with huge files being backed up
could cause longish delays in the output from smbclient that
BackupPC_dump sees, so in rare cases you might want to increase
this value.</p>

month's LOG, these files will have a .z extension if compression

<p><a href="#item__conf_cgiuserhomepagecheck_">$Conf{CgiUserHomePageCheck}</A> should be an absolute file path that
is used to check (via ``-f'') that the user has a valid home page.
Set this to undef or an empty string to turn off this check.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p><a href="#item__conf_cgiuserurlcreate_">$Conf{CgiUserUrlCreate}</A> should be a full URL that points to the
user's home page.  Set this to undef or an empty string to turn
off generation of URLs for user names.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
   <a href="#item__conf_cgiuserhomepagecheck_">$Conf{CgiUserHomePageCheck}</A> = '/var/www/html/users/%s.html';
   <a href="#item__conf_cgiuserurlcreate_">$Conf{CgiUserUrlCreate}</A>     = '<a href="http://myhost/users/%s.html">http://myhost/users/%s.html</a>';
   --&gt; if /var/www/html/users/craig.html exists, then 'craig' will
     be rendered as a link to <a href="http://myhost/users/craig.html">http://myhost/users/craig.html</a>.</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_cgidateformatmmdd_">$Conf{CgiDateFormatMMDD} = 1;</a></strong>

<dd>

and zero for international dates (DD/MM).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_cginavbaradminallhosts_">$Conf{CgiNavBarAdminAllHosts} = 1;</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If set, the complete list of hosts appears in the left navigation
bar pull-down for administrators.  Otherwise, just the hosts for which

<p>Enable/disable the search box in the navigation bar.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_cginavbarlinks_">$Conf{CgiNavBarLinks} = [ ... ];</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Additional navigation bar links.  These appear for both regular users
and administrators.  This is a list of hashes giving the link (URL)
and the text (name) for the link.  Specifying lname instead of name
uses the language specific string (ie: $Lang-&gt;{lname}) instead of
just literally displaying name.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_cgistatushilightcolor_">$Conf{CgiStatusHilightColor} = { ...</a></strong>

Apache's DocumentRoot.  This value isn't used by BackupPC but is
used by configure.pl when you upgrade BackupPC.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Example:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    <a href="#item__conf_cgiimagedir_">$Conf{CgiImageDir}</A> = '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/BackupPC';</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_cgiext2contenttype_">$Conf{CgiExt2ContentType} = { };</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Additional mappings of file name extenions to Content-Type for
individual file restore.  See $Ext2ContentType in BackupPC_Admin
for the default setting.  You can add additional settings here,
or override any default settings.  Example:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    <a href="#item__conf_cgiext2contenttype_">$Conf{CgiExt2ContentType}</A> = {
                'pl'  =&gt; 'text/plain',
         };</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_cgiimagedirurl_">$Conf{CgiImageDirURL} = '';</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>URL (without the leading <a href="http://host)">http://host)</a> for BackupPC's image directory.
The CGI script uses this value to serve up image files.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Example:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    <a href="#item__conf_cgiimagedirurl_">$Conf{CgiImageDirURL}</A> = '/BackupPC';</pre>

in the <a href="#item__conf_cgiimagedir_">$Conf{CgiImageDir}</A> directory and accessed via the
<a href="#item__conf_cgiimagedirurl_">$Conf{CgiImageDirURL}</A> URL.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For BackupPC v3.x several color, layout and font changes were made.
The previous v2.x version is available as BackupPC_stnd_orig.css, so
if you prefer the old skin, change this to BackupPC_stnd_orig.css.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_cgiuserconfigeditenable_">$Conf{CgiUserConfigEditEnable} = 1;</a></strong>

<dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item__conf_cgiuserconfigedit_">$Conf{CgiUserConfigEdit} = { ...</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Which per-host config variables a non-admin user is allowed
to edit.  Admin users can edit all per-host config variables,
even if disabled in this list.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>SECURITY WARNING: Do not let users edit any of the Cmd
config variables!  That's because a user could set a
Cmd to a shell script of their choice and it will be
run as the BackupPC user.  That script could do all
sorts of bad things.</p>

<h1><a name="version_numbers">Version Numbers</a></h1>
<p>Starting with v1.4.0 BackupPC uses a X.Y.Z version numbering system,
instead of X.0Y. The first digit is for major new releases, the middle
digit is for significant feature releases and improvements (most of
the releases have been in this category), and the last digit is for
bug fixes. You should think of the old 1.00, 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03 as
1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.2.0 and 1.3.0.</p>
<p>Additionally, patches might be made available.  A patched version
number is of the form X.Y.ZplN (eg: 2.1.0pl2), where N is the
patch level.</p>
