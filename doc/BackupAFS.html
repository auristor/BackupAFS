<h1><a name="backupafs_introduction">BackupAFS Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This documentation describes BackupAFS version 1.0.0,
released on 22 Nov 2010.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>BackupAFS is a high-performance, enterprise-grade system for backing up 
OpenAFS volumes to a server's disk. This is a strategy commonly known as 
&quot;disk to disk&quot;, or &quot;disk2disk&quot; backup, and thanks to the low cost and 
high performance of modern hard disks, is both fast and economical. 
BackupAFS is highly configurable and easy to install and maintain.</p>
<p>Given the ever decreasing cost of disks and raid systems, it is now 
practical and cost effective to store backups on a (remote) server's 
local disk or network storage. For some sites this might be the complete 
backup solution. For other sites additional permanent archives could be 
created by periodically backing up the server to tape.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Optional compression provides additional reductions in storage (around 35-40%, depending on your data).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A powerful http/cgi user interface allows administrators to view the current status, edit configuration, add/delete volumesets, view log files, and allows users to initiate and cancel backups and browse and restore volumes from backups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No additional software is needed. BackupAFS uses the OpenAFS 'vos' binary and stores its files in standard 'vos dump' format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexible restore options. Volume dump files can be downloaded from any backup directly from the CGI interface. Volumes may also be restored directly into AFS, overwriting any existing volume of the same name or with an optional extension (.restore for instance) to prevent namespace collisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexible configuration parameters allow a configurable number of multiple backups to be performed in parallel, specification of which volumes to backup, various schedules for full and incremental backups, schedules for email notifications to users and admins and so on. Configuration parameters can be set system-wide or also on a per-volumeset basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admins (and optionally users) may be sent periodic email reminders if their volumeset has not recently been backed up. Email content, timing and policies are configurable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BackupAFS is Open Source software hosted by SourceForge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="backup_basics">Backup basics</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="full_backup" class="item">Full Backup</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>A full backup is a complete record of an object (file, volume, volumeset, etc). BackupAFS operates on <strong>volume sets</strong>, which are collections of one or more volumes with common characteristics (generally the same location and/or names that match specified patterns). BackupAFS can be configured to do a full backup at a regular interval (typically monthly). BackupAFS can be configured to keep a certain number of full backups. Exponential expiry is also supported, allowing full backups with various vintages to be kept (for example, a specified number of most recent monthly fulls, plus a specified number of older fulls that are 2, 4, 8, or 16 months apart).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="incremental_backup" class="item">Incremental Backup</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>An incremental backup is a record of changes to one or more objects (files, volumes, volumeset, etc.) that have changed since the last successful full or lower-leveled incremental backup. BackupAFS operates on <strong>volume sets</strong>, which are collections of one or more volumes with common characteristics (generally the same location and/or names that match specified patterns). Multi-level incrementals are supported. A full backup has level 0. A new incremental of level N will backup all files in a given volume that have changed since the most recent backup of a lower level. <a href="#_conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</a> is used to specify the level of each successive incremental. The default value is all level 1, which makes the behavior the same as earlier versions of BackupAFS: each incremental will back up all the files that changed since the last full (level 0).</p>
<p>Immediately before a &quot;vos dump&quot; is performed, the volume in question has a &quot;vos backup&quot; performed on it.</p>
<p>Vos backups are performed using the &quot;vos dump -time &lt;dump from time&gt;&quot; syntax. Discussion on the OpenAFS mailing list confirmed that the -time argument catches even new files with old timestamps (created via touch, tar, etc.) because during vos dumps, AFS decides whether a file has been changed based on the vnode:uniquifier data.</p>
<p>BackupAFS can also be configured to keep a certain number of incremental backups, and to keep a smaller number of very old incremental backups. If multi-level incrementals are specified then it is likely that more incrementals will be kept than specified, since lower-level incrementals (and the full backup) are needed to reconstruct a higher-level incremental.</p>
<p>BackupAFS &quot;fills-in&quot; incremental backups when browsing or restoring, based on the levels of each backup, giving every backup a &quot;full&quot; appearance. This makes browsing and restoring backups much easier: you can restore from any one backup independent of whether it was an incremental or full. BackupAFS will construct the dependency list and restore all parent dumps necessary to reconstruct the original volume.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="backup_policy" class="item">Backup Policy</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Based on your site's requirements you need to decide what your backup policy is. BackupAFS is not designed to provide exact re-imaging of an AFS cell. See <a href="#limitations">Limitations</a> for more information. However, an exact restoration of individual or multiple volumes may be made.</p>
<p>BackupAFS saves backups onto disk. Because of compression you can economically keep several weeks or months of old backups.</p>
<p>At some sites the disk-based backup will be adequate without a secondary tape backup. This system is robust to any single failure: if an AFS fileserver fails or loses volumes, the BackupAFS server can be used to restore those volumes. If the BackupAFS server disk fails, BackupAFS can be restarted on a fresh file system, and create new backups from the volumes still in AFS. The chance of the server disk failing can be made very small by spending more money on increasingly better RAID systems. However, there is still the risk of catastrophic events like fires or earthquakes that can destroy both the BackupAFS server and the fileservers it is backing up if they are physically nearby. Physically separating the BackupAFS server from the AFS fileservers is recommended.</p>
<p>Some sites might choose to do periodic backups to tape or cd/dvd in parallel with BackupAFS. Another alternative would be to do tape backups of the BackupAFS data partition (or only when BackupAFS performs a full dumps, etc.).</p>
<p>Other users have reported success with removable disks to rotate the BackupAFS data drives, or using rsync to mirror the BackupAFS data pool offsite. The truely paranoid might run multiple BackupAFS instances in parallel on separate hardware, at separate locations, or run BackupAFS in parallel with another AFS-aware backup product.</p>

<p>If you just want to mirror linux or unix files or directories that happen to reside in AFS to a remote server you could use rsync, <a href="http://rsync.samba.org">http://rsync.samba.org</a>. You may wish to use rsync to mirror the BackupAFS data store. The BackupAFS data store could also be replicated across the network in realtime with DRBD (for that matter, so could your AFS servers).</p>
<p>Two popular open source packages that do tape backup are Amanda (<a href="http://www.amanda.org">http://www.amanda.org</a>) and Bacula (<a href="http://www.bacula.org">http://www.bacula.org</a>). There are AFS extensions for Amanda (see Amanda-afs below), therefore it might be used as a complete solution. Further either might be used as a back end to BackupAFS to dump the BackupAFS server data to tape.</p>
<p>AFS native backup (butc) - designed to write directly to tapes, but can be configured to write to files directly. Notoriously difficult to configure, manage, and interface with tape libraries and autochangers. When dumping to files, one file represents an entire volumeset (this is different from &quot;vos&quot; dumps, where one file represents one volume).</p>
<p>AFS &quot;vos dump&quot; &amp; &quot;vos restore&quot; - basic AFS commands to dump and restore AFS volumes to and from files. This is what BackupPC4AFS does internally, and many sites use &quot;homegrown&quot; scripts which rely on vos internally.</p>
<p>Amanda-afs - AFS extensions to allow Amanda to backup and restore AFS files. Appears to do this via a vos &lt;-&gt; tar translator.</p>
<p>TSM - Commercial software. There is an extension to IBM's Tivoli Storage Manager to allow it to backup AFS volumes. Apparently no longer marketed or supported.</p>
<p>Veritas NetBackup AFS module - Commercial software. Also apparently no longer supported. Anyone with additional information, please feel free to forward it.</p>
<p>TiBS, Teradactyl's &quot;True incremental Backup System&quot; - Closed-source, commercial software. Actively marketed and supported. While actual prices are not reported on Teradactyl's website, prices charged sites seem to vary somewhat but are usually quite expensive. Teradactyl is an active OpenAFS supporter and several contributors to the OpenAFS lists have admitted to using it.</p>
<p>Others?</p>
<p>BackupAFS provides many additional features, such as compressed storage, easy configuration via CGI, etc. But these other programs provide simple, effective and fast solutions and are definitely worthy of consideration, dependent on your needs and budget.</p>
</dd>

<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="road_map">Road map</a></h2>
<p>The primary developer has some ideas for new features for future releases of BackupAFS. Comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="you_can_help">You can help</a></h2>
<p>BackupAFS is free. I work on BackupAFS because it satisfies the requirements of my use, because I enjoy doing it, and because I like to contribute to the open source community.</p>
<p>My main compensation for continuing to work on BackupAFS is knowing that more and more people find it useful. So feedback is certainly appreciated, both positive and negative.</p>
<p>Beyond being a satisfied user and telling other people about it, everyone
is encouraged to add links to <a href="http://backupafs.sourceforge.net">http://backupafs.sourceforge.net</a>
(I'll see them via Google) or otherwise publicize BackupAFS. Unlike
the commercial products in this space, I have a zero budget (in both
time and money) for marketing, PR and advertising, so it's up to
all of you!  Feel free to vote for BackupAFS at
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/backupafs">http://freshmeat.net/projects/backupafs</a>.</p>
<p>Also, everyone is encouraged to contribute patches, bug reports,
feature and design suggestions, new code, and documentation corrections or improvements.
Answering questions on the mailing list is a big help too.</p>

<h1><a name="installing_backupafs">Installing BackupAFS</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>BackupAFS requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Linux (although Solaris, MacOS X, or other unix-based operating systems can likely be made to work with very little effort).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A substantial amount of free disk space (see the next section for what that means). The CPU and disk performance on this server will determine how many simultaneous backups you can run. You should be able to run 4-8 simultaneous backups on a moderately configured server.</p>
<p>Several sites have reported significantly better performance using xfs compared to ext3 for the BackupAFS data filesystem. It is also recommended you consider either an LVM or RAID setup (either in HW or SW; eg: 3Ware RAID10, RAID5, or RAID6) so that you can expand the file system as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard OpenAFS client, including the 'vos' binary. Use the version provided by your OS, or get it from <a href="http://www.openafs.org">http://www.openafs.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perl version 5.8.0 or later. If you don't have perl, please
see <a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perl modules Compress::Zlib (optional) for compressing log files. Try &quot;perldoc
Compress::Zlib&quot; to see if you have this
module. If not, fetch it from <a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a> and see the
instructions below for how to build and install them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gzip or pigz binary (optional) for compressing dumps. <strong>For multi-core systems, pigz (parallelized gzip algorithm) is strongly suggested</strong>. If your OS lacks these, they can be obtained from <a href="http://www.gzip.org">http://www.gzip.org</a> and <a href="http://www.zlib.net/pigz">http://www.zlib.net/pigz</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Apache web server, see <a href="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</a>, preferably built
with mod_perl support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="what_type_of_storage_space_do_i_need">What type of storage space do I need?</a></h2>
<p>BackupAFS stores its dumps of volumesets on disk. Therefore BackupAFS's data store (__TOPDIR__) should point to a single, large file system (it is ok to use a single symbolic link at the top-level directory (__TOPDIR__) to point the entire data store somewhere else). You can of course use any kind of RAID system or logical volume manager that combines the capacity of multiple disks into a single, larger, file system. Such approaches have the advantage that the file system can be expanded without having to copy it.</p>
<p>Any standard linux or unix file system should work fine. NFS mounted file systems work too. Windows based FAT and NTFS file systems have not been tested, but should work in principle (BackupAFS does not use hard links, but some paths may get very long, depending on both site data store location and volume- and volumeset-naming decisions.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="but_how_much_disk_space_do_i_really_need">But how much disk space do I REALLY need?</a></h2>
<p>Here's one real example for an environment that is backing up 95 volumesets (3500 total volumes) with compression off. The full AFS cell is ~3.5 TB. Storing two full bi-monthly backups and 60 incremental backups per volumeset is around 7.3TB of raw data.</p>
<p>The same cell, with compression on: backing up 95 volumesets (3500 total volumes). Storing two full bi-monthly backups and 60 incremental backups per volumeset takes only 4.7TB of space (approx. a 36% savings).</p>
<p>Your actual mileage will depend upon the types and compressibility of data you backup. The more compressible the data, the bigger benefit compression will be to you.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_1__getting_backupafs">Step 1: Getting BackupAFS</a></h2>
<p>Manually fetching and installing BackupAFS is easy.
Start by downloading the latest version from
<a href="http://backupafs.sourceforge.net">http://backupafs.sourceforge.net</a>. Hit the &quot;Code&quot; button,
then select the &quot;backupafs&quot; or &quot;backupafs-beta&quot; package and
download the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_2__satisfying_the_dependencies">Step 2: Satisfying the Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Note: most information in this step is only relevant if you build
and install BackupAFS yourself. If you use a package provided by a
distribution, the package management system should take of installing
any needed dependencies.</p>
<p>First off, there are two perl modules you should install.
These are all optional, but highly recommended:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="compress_zlib" class="item">Compress::Zlib</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>To enable log compression, you will need to install Compress::Zlib
from <a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>.
You can run &quot;perldoc Compress::Zlib&quot; to see if this module is installed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="xml_rss" class="item">XML::RSS</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>To support the (experimental) RSS feature you will need to install XML::RSS, also from
<a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>. There is not need to install this module if you
don't plan on using RSS. You can run &quot;perldoc XML::RSS&quot; to see if this
module is installed.</p>
<p>To build and install these packages you may wish to use the cpan program.
Alternatively, you can fetch the tar.gz file from <a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>
and then run these commands:</p>
<pre>
    tar zxvf Compress-Zip-1.26.tar.gz
    cd Compress-Zip-1.26
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install</pre>
<p>The same sequence of commands can be used for each module.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="openafs_client" class="item">OpenAFS Client</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The BackupAFS server must be an AFS client for your AFS cell. So, if you have not already, you should install and configure the OpenAFS client using the settings for your cell. Many popular linux distributions include a pre-packaged version of the client. If your distribution does not, or if you prefer not to use it, you can download it from <a href="http://www.openafs.org">http://www.openafs.org</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="compression_executable" class="item">Compression executable</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>BackupAFS can optionally compress volume dumps using either gzip or pigz for compression. Both applications perform compression using the gzip algorithm; pigz is simply a parallel implementation designed to leverage multiple cores in modern multi-CPU servers. If your distribution does not include the one you choose, you may download Gzip from <a href="http://www.gzip.org/">http://www.gzip.org/</a> or Pigz from <a href="http://www.zlib.net/pigz/">http://www.zlib.net/pigz/</a>. <strong>If you have a multi-processor system, pigz is strongly recommended.</strong></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_3__installing_the_backupafs_software">Step 3: Installing the BackupAFS software</a></h2>
<p>Now let's move onto BackupAFS itself. After fetching
BackupAFS-1.0.0.tar.gz, run these commands as root:</p>
<pre>
    tar zxf BackupAFS-1.0.0.tar.gz
    cd BackupAFS-1.0.0
    perl configure.pl</pre>
<p>In the future this release might also have patches available on the
SourceForge site. These patch files are text files, with a name of
the form</p>
<pre>
    BackupAFS-1.0.0plN.diff</pre>
<p>where N is the patch level, eg: pl2 is patch-level 2. These
patch files are cumulative: you only need apply the last patch
file, not all the earlier patch files. If a patch file is
available, eg: BackupAFS-1.0.0pl2.diff, you should apply
the patch after extracting the tar file:</p>
<pre>
     # fetch BackupAFS-1.0.0.tar.gz
     # fetch BackupAFS-1.0.0pl2.diff
     tar zxf BackupAFS-1.0.0.tar.gz
     cd BackupAFS-1.0.0
     patch -p0 &lt; ../BackupAFS-1.0.0pl2.diff
     perl configure.pl</pre>
<p>A patch file includes comments that describe that bug fixes
and changes. Feel free to review it before you apply the patch.</p>
<p>The configure.pl script also accepts command-line options if you
wish to run it in a non-interactive manner. It has self-contained
documentation for all the command-line options, which you can
read with perldoc:</p>
<pre>
    perldoc configure.pl</pre>
<p>The configure.pl script by default
complies with the file system hierarchy (FHS) conventions. The
configuration files will be stored in /etc/BackupAFS
and the log files will be stored in /var/log/BackupAFS.</p>
<p>Note that distributions may choose to use different locations for
BackupAFS files than these defaults.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier version the configure.pl script
will keep the configuration files and log files in their original
location.</p>
<p>When you run configure.pl you will be prompted for the full paths
of various executables, and you will be prompted for the following
information.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="backupafs_user" class="item">BackupAFS User</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>It is best if BackupAFS runs as a special user, eg backupafs, that has
limited privileges. It is preferred that backupafs belongs to a system
administrator group so that sys admin members can browse BackupAFS files,
edit the configuration files and so on. Although configurable, the
default settings leave group read permission on backup directories, so make
sure the BackupAFS user's group is chosen restrictively.</p>
<p>On this installation, this is backup.</p>
<p>For security purposes you might choose to configure the BackupAFS
user with the shell set to /bin/false. Since you might need to
run some BackupAFS programs as the BackupAFS user for testing
purposes, you can use the -s option to su to explicitly run
a shell, eg:</p>
<pre>
    su -s /bin/bash backup</pre>
<p>Depending upon your configuration you might also need the -l option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="data_directory" class="item">Data Directory</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>You need to decide where to put the data directory, below which
all the BackupAFS data is stored. This needs to be a big file system.

<h2><a name="step_5__adding_your_afs_keyfile">Step 5: Adding your AFS KeyFile</a></h2>
<p>In order to perform vos dump operations without tokens, we need to copy the AFS cell's keyfile to the BackupAFS server. <strong>This keyfile must be protected</strong>. Only the backupafs user should be able to read it. <em>This means that the BackupAFS server should be kept as secure as your AFS fileservers.</em> This document won't devolve into a security lecture, but suffice it to say you should turn off all unnecessary services and wrap or firewall the remaining services.</p>
<p>Modern Debian/Ubuntu distributions store the KeyFile in the /etc/openafs/server directory. That directory on AFS fileserver machines normally includes other files (ThisCell, CellServDB, UserList, and possibly CellAlias); those files will not harm the BackupAFS server. It is advised to copy the entire /etc/openafs/server directory from an existing fileserver to the BackupAFS server.</p>
<p>If the version of OpenAFS supplied by your operating system (or you, if you manually install) expects the KeyFile in a different location, place the copy in that location instead of /etc/openafs/server.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
    backupserver:~ # mkdir -p /etc/openafs/server
    backupserver:~ # chmod 700 /etc/openafs/server
    backupserver:~ # cd /etc/openafs
    backupserver:/etc/openafs # scp -R root@fileserver1:/etc/openafs/server server/
    root@fileserver1's password:

<h2><a name="step_6__setting_up_the_volumeset_list_file">Step 6: Setting up the VolumeSet-List file</a></h2>
<p>The file /etc/BackupAFS/VolumeSet-List contains the list and definitions of volumesets to backup.
BackupAFS reads this file in three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upon startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When BackupAFS is sent a HUP (-1) signal. Assuming you installed the
init.d script, you can also do this with &quot;/etc/init.d/backupafs reload&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the modification time of the VolumeSet-List file changes. BackupAFS
checks the modification time once during each regular wakeup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you change the VolumeSet-List file (to add or remove a volset) you can
either do a <code>kill -HUP BackupAFS_pid</code> or simply wait until the next regular
wakeup period.</p>
<p>Each line in the VolumeSet-List file contains multiple fields, separated
by a colon (:)</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="volset" class="item">volset (name of the VolumeSet)</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This is the definitive name of the volumeset and should be in lower case. The volset name should contain only lowercase alphanumerics. The use of non-alphanumeric characters may be possible (preceded by a backslash), but it is not recommended.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="user" class="item">user (user name)</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This should be the unix login/email name of the user who &quot;owns&quot; or uses
this volset. This is the user who will be sent email about this
volset, and this user will have permission to stop/start/browse/restore
backups for this volset. Leave this blank if no specific person should
receive email or be allowed to stop/start/browse/restore backups
for this volset. Administrators will still have full permissions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="moreusers" class="item">moreUsers (more user names)</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Additional user names, separated by commas and with no white space,
can be specified. These users will also have full permission in
the CGI interface to stop/start/browse/restore backups for this volset.
These users will not be sent email about this volset.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="volume_entries_1_5" class="item">(volume entries 1 - 5)</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>To paraphrase the OpenAFS Administrator's Guide, &quot;a single volumeset consists of [between one and five] volume entries, each of which specifies which volumes to backup based on their location (file server machine and partition) and volume name.&quot; BackupAFS represents the location as Entry<em>X</em>_Servers and Entry<em>X</em>_Partitions. Volume names are specified by Entry<em>X</em>_Volumes, where X is an integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.</p>
<p>The full list of fields which represent volume entries is</p>
<pre>
    Entry1_Servers, Entry1_Partitions, Entry1_Volumes
    Entry2_Servers, Entry2_Partitions, Entry2_Volumes
    Entry3_Servers, Entry3_Partitions, Entry3_Volumes
    Entry4_Servers, Entry4_Partitions, Entry4_Volumes
    Entry5_Servers, Entry5_Partitions, Entry5_Volumes</pre>
<p>All of these fields are actually regular expressions. Those of you familar with regular expressions will recall that the period &quot;.&quot; represents any valid character, therefore literal periods in hostnames must be escaped (preceded by a backslash &quot;\&quot;). <strong>Because it is normal to dump only AFS backup volumes (that is the normal volume name with a .backup suffix), it is normal to include \.backup in the regular expression for Entry<em>X</em>_Volumes.</strong> BackupAFS will create the .backup volumes if they do not exist (or re-create them if they do), immediately prior to dumping each volume.</p>
<p>Examples of valid values of Entry1_Servers include:</p>
<pre>
    fileserver1\.mydomain\.com
    london-fs.*\.mydomain\.com
    .*-fs1\.mydomain\.com
    .*</pre>
<p>Examples of valid values of Entry<em>X</em>_Partitions include:</p>
<pre>
    /vicepa
    /vicepa.*
    .*</pre>
<p>Examples of valid values of Entry<em>X</em>_Volumes include:</p>
<pre>
    .*\.backup
    prj\.dept\.backup
    prj\.dept\..*\.backup
    user\.a.*\.backup</pre>
<p>Entry1_Servers, Entry1_Partitions, and Entry1_Volumes together define one group of volumes which will be backed up in the volumeset. Each volumeset may have up to 5 volume entries comprising it.</p>
<p>Combining servers, partitions, and volumes usefully in combinations depends on the desired result and the characteristics of the volumes you wish to backup.</p>
<p>Some examples from the OpenAFS Administrator's Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To backup all volumes in the VLDB, use the regular expression .* in all three parts of the volume entry (Entry1_Servers, Entry1_Partitions, Entry1_Volumes) (Example &quot;myvolset:::.*:.*:.*\.backup&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every volume on a specific fileserver machine, specify its fully qualified hostname in the &quot;Entry<em>X</em>_Servers&quot; field and use the regular expression .* for the Entry<em>X</em>_Partitions and Entry<em>X</em>_Volumes fields. (Example &quot;myvolset:jondoe:janedoe:fileserver1\.mydomain\.com:.*:.*&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All volumes that reside on a partition with the same name on various file server machines, specify the complete partition name in the Entry<em>X</em>_Partitions field and use the regular expression .* for the Entry<em>X</em>_Servers and Entry<em>X</em>_Volumes fields (Example &quot;myvolset:jondoe:janedoe:.*:/vicepa:.*&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every volume with a common string in its name, use the regular expression .* for the Entry<em>X</em>_Servers and Entry<em>X</em>_Partitions fields, and provide a combination of alphanumeric characters and metacharacters in the Entry<em>X</em>_Volumes field (Example &quot;myvolset:jondoe:janedoe:.*:.*:user.*\.backup&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All volumes on one partition, specify the fileserver machine's fully qualified hostname as the Entry<em>X</em>_Servers field, the full partition name as the Entry<em>X</em>_Partitions field, and the regular expression .* for the Entry<em>X</em>_Volumes field. (Example &quot;myvolset:jondoe:janedoe:fileserver1\.mydomain\.com:/vicepa:.*\.backup&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single volume, specify its complete name in the Entry<em>X</em>_Volumes field. To bypass the potentially time-consuming search through the VLDB for matching entries, you may specify the actual fileserver machine and partition name in the Entry<em>X</em>_Servers and Entry<em>X</em>_Partitions fields, respectively. However if it is possible that you will need to move the volume in the future, it is best to use the regular expression .* for the server and partition names. (Example &quot;myvolset:jondoe:janedow:.*:.*:user\.bigwig\.backup&quot;)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because all of the volumes within a single volumeset are dumped to disk at the same time (daily, weekly, monthly, etc) and in the same manner (full or incremental), a volumeset generally includes volumes with similar contents or characteristics (as indicated by similar names). This grouping by name is generally more useful than one that treats volumes by location, unless your cell includes geographically-separated fileservers. The most common, most useful value for Entry<em>X</em>_Servers and Entry<em>X</em>_Partitions is the regular expression .* (period followed by an asterisk).</p>
<p>It is generally advisable to include a limited number of volumes in a volume entry. Dumps of a volumeset that includes a large number of volumes can take a long time to complete.</p>
<p>It is generally advisable to strive for staggered full backups. That is if you have 14 volumesets and you intend to perform full backups every 2 weeks, you stagger your backup rotation so that each volumeset's full takes place on a different night. If you do not do this, or if one volumeset is disproportionately large compared to the others, your BackupAFS server will work hard during that full and be mostly-idle the rest of the time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first non-comment line of the VolumeSet-List file is special: it contains
the names of the fields and should not be edited.</p>
<p>Here's a simple example of a VolumeSet-List file:</p>
<pre>
    volset:user:moreUsers:Entry1_Servers:Entry1_Partitions:Entry1_Volumes:Entry2_Servers:Entry2_Partitions:Entry2_Volumes:Entry3_Servers:Entry3_Partitions:Entry3_Volumes:Entry4_Servers:Entry4_Partitions:Entry4_Volumes:Entry5_Servers:Entry5_Partitions:Entry5_Volumes
    class_all:jondoe::.*:.*:class\..*\.backup::::::::::::
    user_a:::.*:.*:user\.a.*\.backup::::::::::::
    user_z:::.*:.*:user\.z.*\.backup::::::::::::</pre>
<p><strong>The easiest method of editing volumesets is to use the CGI, once configured.</strong></p>
<p>All fields except volset, Entry1_Servers, Entry1_Partitions, and Entry1_Volumes may be blank.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_7__cgi_interface">Step 7: CGI interface</a></h2>
<p>The CGI interface script, <code>BackupAFS_Admin</code>, is a powerful and flexible
way to see and control what BackupAFS is doing. It is written for an
Apache server. If you don't have Apache, see <a href="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</a>.</p>
<p>There are two options for setting up the CGI interface: standard
mode and using mod_perl. Mod_perl provides much higher performance
(around 15x) and is the best choice if your Apache was built with
mod_perl support. To see if your apache was built with mod_perl
run this command:</p>
<pre>
    httpd -l | egrep mod_perl</pre>
<p>If this prints mod_perl.c then your Apache supports mod_perl.</p>
<p>Note: on some distributions (like Debian) the command is not &quot;httpd&quot;,
but &quot;apache&quot; or &quot;apache2&quot;. Those distributions will generally also
use &quot;www-data&quot; for the Apache user account and configuration files.</p>
<p>Using mod_perl with BackupAFS_Admin requires a dedicated Apache
to be run as the BackupAFS user (backup). This is
because BackupAFS_Admin needs permission to access various files
in BackupAFS's data directories. In contrast, the standard
installation (without mod_perl) solves this problem by having
BackupAFS_Admin installed as setuid to the BackupAFS user, so that
BackupAFS_Admin runs as the BackupAFS user.</p>
<p>Here are some specifics for each setup:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="standard_setup" class="item">Standard Setup</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The CGI interface should have been installed by the configure.pl script
in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/BackupAFS_Admin. BackupAFS_Admin should have been installed
as setuid to the BackupAFS user (backup), in addition to user
and group execute permission.</p>
<p>You should be very careful about permissions on BackupAFS_Admin and
the directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin: it is important that normal users cannot
directly execute or change BackupAFS_Admin, otherwise they can access
backup files for any volset. You might need to change the group ownership
of BackupAFS_Admin to a group that Apache belongs to so that Apache
can execute it (don't add &quot;other&quot; execute permission!).
The permissions should look like this:</p>
<pre>
    ls -l /usr/lib/cgi-bin/BackupAFS_Admin
    -swxr-x---    1 backup   web      82406 Jun 17 22:58 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/BackupAFS_Admin</pre>
<p>The setuid script won't work unless perl on your machine was installed
with setuid emulation. This is likely the problem if you get an error
saying such as &quot;Wrong user: my userid is 25, instead of 150&quot;, meaning
the script is running as the httpd user, not the BackupAFS user.
This is because setuid scripts are disabled by the kernel in most
flavors of unix and linux.</p>
<p>To see if your perl has setuid emulation, see if there is a program
called sperl5.8.0 (or sperl5.8.2 etc, based on your perl version)
in the place where perl is installed. If you can't find this program,
then you have three options: rebuild and reinstall perl with the setuid
emulation turned on (answer &quot;y&quot; to the question &quot;Do you want to do
setuid/setgid emulation?&quot; when you run perl's configure script), 
switch to the mod_perl alternative for the CGI script (which doesn't
need setuid to work), or run apache as the BackupAFS user (which will
not require setuid to work)..</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="mod_perl_setup" class="item">Mod_perl Setup</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The advantage of the mod_perl setup is that no setuid script is needed,
and there is a huge performance advantage. Not only does all the perl
code need to be parsed just once, the config.pl and VolumeSet-List files, plus
the connection to the BackupAFS server are cached between requests. The
typical speedup is around 15 times.</p>
<p>To use mod_perl you need to run Apache as user backup.
If you need to run multiple Apache's for different services then
you need to create multiple top-level Apache directories, each
with their own config file. You can make copies of /etc/init.d/httpd
and use the -d option to httpd to point each http to a different
top-level directory. Or you can use the -f option to explicitly
point to the config file. Multiple Apache's will run on different
Ports (eg: 80 is standard, 8080 is a typical alternative port accessed
via <a href="http://yourhost.com:8080).">http://yourhost.com:8080).</a></p>
<p>Inside BackupAFS's Apache http.conf file you should check the
settings for ServerRoot, DocumentRoot, User, Group, and Port. See 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/server-wide.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/server-wide.html</a> for more details.</p>
<p>For mod_perl, BackupAFS_Admin should not have setuid permission, so
you should turn it off:</p>
<pre>
    chmod u-s /usr/lib/cgi-bin/BackupAFS_Admin</pre>
<p>To tell Apache to use mod_perl to execute BackupAFS_Admin, add this
to Apache's 1.x httpd.conf file:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;IfModule mod_perl.c&gt;
        PerlModule Apache::Registry
        PerlTaintCheck On
        &lt;Location /cgi-bin/BackupAFS/BackupAFS_Admin&gt;   # &lt;--- change path as needed
           SetHandler perl-script
           PerlHandler Apache::Registry
           Options ExecCGI
           PerlSendHeader On
        &lt;/Location&gt;
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;</pre>
<p>Apache 2.0.44 with Perl 5.8.0 on RedHat 7.1, Don Silvia reports that
this works (with tweaks from Michael Tuzi):</p>
<pre>
    LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so
    PerlModule Apache2</pre>
<pre>
    &lt;Directory /path/to/cgi/&gt;
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
        PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
        Options +ExecCGI
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 192.168.0  
        AuthName &quot;Backup Admin&quot;
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile /path/to/user_file
        Require valid-user
    &lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
<p>There are other optimizations and options with mod_perl. For
example, you can tell mod_perl to preload various perl modules,
which saves memory compared to loading separate copies in every
Apache process after they are forked. See Stas's definitive
mod_perl guide at <a href="http://perl.apache.org/guide">http://perl.apache.org/guide</a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>BackupAFS_Admin requires that users are authenticated by Apache.
Specifically, it expects that Apache sets the REMOTE_USER environment
variable when it runs. There are several ways to do this. One way
is to create a .htaccess file in the cgi-bin directory that looks like:</p>
<pre>
    AuthGroupFile /etc/httpd/conf/group    # &lt;--- change path as needed
    AuthUserFile /etc/http/conf/passwd     # &lt;--- change path as needed
    AuthType basic
    AuthName &quot;access&quot;
    require valid-user</pre>
<p>You will also need &quot;AllowOverride Indexes AuthConfig&quot; in the Apache
httpd.conf file to enable the .htaccess file. Alternatively, everything
can go in the Apache httpd.conf file inside a Location directive. The
list of users and password file above can be extracted from the NIS
passwd file.</p>
<p>One alternative is to use LDAP. In Apache's http.conf add these lines:</p>
<pre>
    LoadModule auth_ldap_module   modules/auth_ldap.so
    AddModule auth_ldap.c</pre>
<pre>
    # cgi-bin - auth via LDAP (for BackupAFS)
    &lt;Location /cgi-binBackupAFS/BackupAFS_Admin&gt;    # &lt;--- change path as needed
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName &quot;BackupAFS login&quot;
      # replace MYDOMAIN, PORT, ORG and CO as needed
      AuthLDAPURL ldap://ldap.MYDOMAIN.com:PORT/o=ORG,c=CO?uid?sub?(objectClass=*)
      require valid-user
    &lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
<p>If you want to disable the user authentication you can set
<a href="#_conf_cgiadminusers_">$Conf{CgiAdminUsers}</a> to '*', which allows any user to have
full access to all VolumeSets and backups. In this case the REMOTE_USER
environment variable does not have to be set by Apache.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can force a particular user name by getting Apache
to set REMOTE_USER, eg, to hardcode the user to www you could add
this to Apache's httpd.conf:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;Location /cgi-bin/BackupAFS/BackupAFS_Admin&gt;   # &lt;--- change path as needed
        Setenv REMOTE_USER www
    &lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
<p>Finally, you should also edit the config.pl file and adjust, as necessary,
the CGI-specific settings. They're near the end of the config file. In
particular, you should specify which users or groups have administrator
(privileged) access: see the config settings <a href="#_conf_cgiadminusergroup_">$Conf{CgiAdminUserGroup}</a>
and <a href="#_conf_cgiadminusers_">$Conf{CgiAdminUsers}</a>. Also, the configure.pl script placed various
images into <a href="#_conf_cgiimagedir_">$Conf{CgiImageDir}</a> that BackupAFS_Admin needs to serve
up. You should make sure that <a href="#_conf_cgiimagedirurl_">$Conf{CgiImageDirURL}</a> is the correct
URL for the image directory.</p>
<p>See the section <a href="#fixing_installation_problems">Fixing installation problems</a> for suggestions on debugging the Apache authentication setup.</p>

</p>
<h2><a name="step_8__running_backupafs">Step 8: Running BackupAFS</a></h2>
<p>The installation contains an init.d backupafs script that can be copied
to /etc/init.d so that BackupAFS can auto-start on boot.
See init.d/README for further instructions.</p>
<p>BackupAFS should be ready to start. If you installed the init.d script,
then you should be able to run BackupAFS with:</p>
<pre>
    /etc/init.d/backupafs start</pre>
<p>(This script can also be invoked with &quot;stop&quot; to stop BackupAFS and &quot;reload&quot;
to tell BackupAFS to reload config.pl and the VolumeSet-List file.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, just run</p>
<pre>
     __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS -d</pre>
<p>as user backup. The -d option tells BackupAFS to run as a daemon
(ie: it does an additional fork).</p>
<p>Any immediate errors will be printed to stderr and BackupAFS will quit.
Otherwise, look in /var/log/BackupAFS/LOG and verify that BackupAFS reports
it has started and all is ok.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_9__talking_to_backupafs">Step 9: Talking to BackupAFS</a></h2>
<p>You should verify that BackupAFS is running by using <code>BackupAFS_serverMesg</code>.
This sends a message to BackupAFS via the unix (or TCP) socket and prints
the response. Like all BackupAFS programs, <code>BackupAFS_serverMesg</code>
should be run as the BackupAFS user (backup), so you
should</p>
<pre>
    su backup</pre>
<p>before running <code>BackupAFS_serverMesg</code>. If the BackupAFS user is
configured with /bin/false as the shell, you can use the -s
option to su to explicitly run a shell, eg:</p>
<pre>
    su -s /bin/bash backup</pre>
<p>Depending upon your configuration you might also need
the -l option.</p>
<p>You can request status information and start and stop backups using this
interface. This socket interface is mainly provided for the CGI interface
(and some of the BackupAFS sub-programs use it too). But right now we just
want to make sure BackupAFS is happy. Each of these commands should
produce some status output:</p>
<pre>
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_serverMesg status info
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_serverMesg status jobs
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_serverMesg status volsets</pre>
<p>The output should be some hashes printed with Data::Dumper. If it
looks cryptic and confusing, and doesn't look like an error message,
then all is ok.</p>
<p>The jobs status should initially show just <code>BackupAFS_trashClean</code>.
The volsets status should produce a list of every VolumeSet you have listed
in /etc/BackupAFS/VolumeSet-List as part of a big cryptic output line.</p>
<p>You can also request that all volsets be queued:</p>
<pre>
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_serverMesg backup all</pre>
<p>At this point you should make sure the CGI interface works since
it will be much easier to see what is going on. That's our
next subject.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="step_10__checking_email_delivery">Step 10: Checking email delivery</a></h2>
<p>The script <code>BackupAFS_sendEmail</code> sends status and error emails to
the administrator and users. It is usually run each night
by <code>BackupAFS_nightly</code>.</p>
<p>To verify that it can run sendmail and deliver email correctly
you should ask it to send a test email to you:</p>
<pre>
    su backup
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_sendEmail -u MYNAME@MYDOMAIN.COM</pre>
<p><code>BackupAFS_sendEmail</code> also takes a -c option that checks if BackupAFS
is running, and it sends an email to <a href="#_conf_emailadminusername_">$Conf{EMailAdminUserName}</a>
if it is not. That can be used as a keep-alive check by adding</p>
<pre>
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_sendEmail -c</pre>
<p>to backup's cron.</p>
<p>The -t option to <code>BackupAFS_sendEmail</code> causes it to print the email
message instead of invoking sendmail to deliver the message.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="removing_a_volumeset" class="item">Removing a VolumeSet</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>If there is a volset that no longer needs to be backed up (eg: some
volumes are renamed or deleted) you have two choices. First, you can keep the backups accessible
and browsable, but disable all new backups. Alternatively, you can
completely remove the VolumeSet and all its backups.</p>
<p>To disable backups for a volset <a href="#_conf_backupsdisable_">$Conf{BackupsDisable}</a> can be
set to two different values in that VolumeSet's per-volset config.pl file:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don't do any regular backups on this volset. Manually
requested backups (via the CGI interface) will still occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't do any backups on this volset. Manually requested
backups (via the CGI interface) will be ignored.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This will still allow the volset's old backups to be browsable
and restorable.</p>
<p>To completely remove a VolumeSet and all its backups, you should remove its
entry in the conf/VolumeSet-List file, and then delete the __TOPDIR__/volsets/<em>$volset</em>
directory. Whenever you change the VolumeSet-List file, you should send
BackupAFS a HUP (-1) signal so that it re-reads the VolumeSet-List file.
If you don't do this, BackupAFS will automatically re-read the
VolumeSet-List file at the next regular wakeup.</p>

<h1><a name="restore_functions">Restore functions</a></h1>
<p>By selecting a volumeset in the CGI interface, a list of all the backups for that volset will be displayed. By selecting the backup number you can navigate the volumes tree for that volumeset.</p>
<p>BackupAFS's CGI interface automatically displays a <em>merged</em> or <em>filled</em> view when browsing backups. This means that viewing incremental backups shows files from all other backups (full and other incrementals) on which the backup depends, Therefore, there is no need to do multiple restores from the incremental and full backups: BackupAFS does all the hard work for you. You simply select the files and directories you want from the correct backup vintage in one step.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="browser_download">Browser Download</a></h2>
<p>You may download a single backup file at any time simply by selecting it. Your browser should prompt you with the file name and ask you whether to open the file or save it to disk (you will wish to save it, &quot;gunzip&quot; and &quot;vos restore&quot; it).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="direct_restore">Direct Restore</a></h2>
<p>Alternatively, you can select one or more files or directories in the currently selected directory and select &quot;Restore selected files&quot;. (If you need to restore selected files and directories from several different parent directories you will need to do that in multiple steps.)</p>
<p>If you select all the files in a directory, BackupAFS will replace the list of files with the parent directory. You will be presented with a screen that explains the restore process.</p>
<p>With this method the selected files and directories are restored directly back into AFS, by default with a similar volumename (&quot;.r&quot; is appended unless you change it). You must change the default values for the AFS fileserver and partition to valid values for your AFS cell. You may wish to change the default extension, or leave it as-is. <strong>If you remove the extension totally, leaving it blank, any existing volume with the same name will be overwritten, so use caution.</strong></p>
<p>Once you select &quot;Start Restore&quot; you will be prompted one last time with a summary of the exact source and target volume(s) before you commit. When you give the final go ahead the restore operation will be queued like a normal backup job, meaning that it will be deferred if there is a backup currently running for that volumeset. When the restore job is run, a &quot;vos restore&quot; operation is used to actually restore the volume(s). There is currently no option to cancel a restore that has been started.</p>
<p>A record of the restore request, including the result and list of volumes, is kept. It can be browsed from the VolumeSet's home page. <a href="#_conf_restoreinfokeepcnt_">$Conf{RestoreInfoKeepCnt}</a> specifies how many old restore status files to keep.</p>
<p>Note that for direct restore to work, the <a href="#_conf_xfermethod_">$Conf{XferMethod}</a> must be able to write to the destination. Because the only XferMethod available is vos, this means that &quot;vos restore&quot; with the &quot;-localauth&quot; option must succeed. This requires that the AFS cell's KeyFile be present on the BackupAFS server's disk. This creates additional security risks, as mentioned in the installation portion of this document.</p>

<p>When changes are made to any parameter a &quot;Save&quot; button appears

<p>When editing the volset-specific configuration, each parameter has
an &quot;override&quot; setting that denotes the value is volset-specific,
meaning that it overrides the setting in the main configuration.
If you unselect &quot;override&quot; then the setting is removed from
the volset-specific configuration, and the main configuration

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="compression" class="item">Compression</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>BackupAFS supports compression. It uses the deflate and inflate methods in the Compress::Zlib module, which is based on the zlib compression library (see <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>) for log files and the gzip (see <a href="http://www.gzip.org/">http://www.gzip.org/</a>) or pigz (see <a href="http://www.zlib.net/pigz/">http://www.zlib.net/pigz/</a>) executable to compress volume dump files. <strong>If you have a multi-processor system, pigz is strongly recommended.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="#_conf_compresslevel_">$Conf{CompressLevel}</a> setting specifies the compression level to use. Zero (0) means no compression. Compression levels can be from 1 (least cpu time, slightly worse compression) to 9 (most cpu time, slightly better compression). The recommended value is 3 or 4. Changing it to 5, for example, will take maybe 20% more cpu time and will get another 2-3% additional compression. Diminishing returns set in above 5. See the gzip documentation for more information about compression levels.</p>
<p>Using compression can yield a 35% or more overall saving in backup storage.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="backupafs_operation">BackupAFS operation</a></h2>
<p>BackupAFS reads the configuration information from
/etc/BackupAFS/config.pl. It then runs and manages all the backup
activity. It maintains queues of pending backup requests, user backup
requests and administrative commands. Based on the configuration various
requests will be executed simultaneously.</p>
<p>As specified by <a href="#_conf_wakeupschedule_">$Conf{WakeupSchedule}</a>, BackupAFS wakes up periodically
to queue backups on all the VolumeSets. This is a four step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For each VolumeSet backup requests are queued on the background command queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each VolumeSet, BackupAFS_dump is forked. Several of these may be run in
parallel, based on the configuration. The file __TOPDIR__/volsets/<em>VolumeSet Name</em>/backups
is read to decide whether a full or incremental backup needs to be run. If no backup is scheduled, then BackupAFS_dump exits.</p>
<p>The backup is done using the specified XferMethod. The only XferMethod available in BackupAFS is vos. BackupAFS_dump uses BackupAFS_getVols to construct a list of volumes for the given VolumeSet. It does this by first reading the list of volume entries for the given VolumeSet. Then, by querying the AFS dbservers for a list of all fileservers, querying each fileserver for a list of partitions, and querying the VLDB for a list of volumes on each matching server/partition, each volume matching the criteria is returned. Then BackupAFS_vosWrapper is spawned for each volume. Depending on the type of dump, it determines whether a backup is necessary, and if so, performs the actual &quot;vos dump&quot; with the correct arguments.</p>
<p>The volume dump files are stored in __TOPDIR__/volsets/<em>VolumeSet Name</em>/new. The XferMethod output is stored into __TOPDIR__/volsets/&lt;VolumeSet Name&gt;/XferLOG.</p>
<p>When the entire list of matching volumes has been processed, the forked BackupAFS_dump exits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each complete, good, backup, BackupAFS_compress is run. To avoid excessive resource contention, only a single BackupAFS_compress program runs at a time and the rest are queued.</p>
<p>BackupAFS_compress reads the NewFileList written by BackupAFS_dump and if compression has been requested, it spawns a gzip or pigz process to compress the sequentially for each file. If both gzip and pigz executables are available, it will use pigz. Pigz defaults to a number of threads equal to the number of cores available on the BackupAFS system. This can be overridden by specifying or changing the value of <a href="#_conf_pigzthreads_">$Conf{PigzThreads}</a>. Overriding this value allows the admin to fine-tune the CPU and IO usage of pigz.</p>
<p>The CGI interface knows how to merge each incremental backups with all lower-level dumps on which it depends, giving the incremental backups a complete appearance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BackupAFS_trashClean is always run in the background to remove any
expired backups. Every 5 minutes it wakes up and removes all the files
in __TOPDIR__/trash.</p>
<p>Also, once each night, BackupAFS_nightly is run to complete some
additional administrative tasks, such as aging of log files. To avoid race conditions, BackupAFS_nightly is only run when there are no BackupAFS_compress processes running. When BackupAFS_nightly is run no new BackupAFS_compress jobs are started.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>BackupAFS also listens for TCP connections on <a href="#_conf_serverport_">$Conf{ServerPort}</a>, which
is used by the CGI script BackupAFS_Admin for status reporting and
user-initiated backup or backup cancel requests.</p>

<h2><a name="file_name_mangling">File name mangling</a></h2>
<p>Backup file names are no longer stored in &quot;mangled&quot; form. In BackupPC4AFS
(and in BackupPC), each node of
a path is preceded by &quot;f&quot; (mnemonic: file), and special characters
(\n, \r, % and /) are URI-encoded as &quot;%xx&quot;, where xx is the ascii
character's hex value. So c:/craig/example.txt is now stored as
fc/fcraig/fexample.txt.</p>
<p>This was done mainly so meta-data could be stored alongside the backup
files without name collisions. In particular, the attributes for the
files in a directory are stored in a file called &quot;attrib&quot;, and mangling
avoids file name collisions (I discarded the idea of having a duplicate
directory tree for every backup just to store the attributes). Other
meta-data (eg: rsync checksums) could be stored in file names preceded
by, eg, &quot;c&quot;. There are two other benefits to mangling: the share name
might contain &quot;/&quot; (eg: &quot;/home/craig&quot; for tar transport), and I wanted
that represented as a single level in the storage tree. Secondly, as
files are written to NewFileList for later processing by BackupAFS_compress,
embedded newlines in the file's path will cause problems which are
avoided by mangling.</p>
<p>The CGI script undoes the mangling, so it is invisible to the user.
Both mangled and unmangled backups are still viewable by the CGI interface 
as long as the entry in the backups file is correctly set for that dump.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<p>BackupAFS isn't perfect (but it is getting better). Please see
<a href="http://backupafs.sourceforge.net/faq/limitations.html">http://backupafs.sourceforge.net/faq/limitations.html</a> for a
discussion of some of BackupAFS's limitations.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="security_issues">Security issues</a></h2>
<p>In order to perform vos dump operations without tokens, we need to copy the AFS cell's keyfile to the BackupAFS server. This keyfile must be protected. Only the backupafs user should be able to read it. This means that the BackupAFS server should be kept as secure as your AFS fileservers. This document won't devolve into a security lecture, but suffice it to say you should turn off all unnecessary services and wrap or firewall the remaining services.</p>

<h1><a name="configuration_file">Configuration File</a></h1>
<p>The BackupAFS configuration file resides in /etc/BackupAFS/config.pl.
Optional per-PC configuration files reside in /etc/BackupAFS/volsets/$VolumeSet.pl
This file can be used to override settings just for a particular PC.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="modifying_the_main_configuration_file">Modifying the main configuration file</a></h2>
<p>The configuration file is a perl script that is executed by BackupAFS, so
you should be careful to preserve the file syntax (punctuation, quotes
etc) when you edit it. It is recommended that you use CVS, RCS or some
other method of source control for changing config.pl.</p>
<p>BackupAFS reads or re-reads the main configuration file and
the VolumeSet-List file in three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upon startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When BackupAFS is sent a HUP (-1) signal. Assuming you installed the 
init.d script, you can also do this with &quot;/etc/init.d/backupafs reload&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the modification time of config.pl file changes. BackupAFS
checks the modification time once during each regular wakeup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you change the configuration file you can either do
a kill -HUP BackupAFS_pid or simply wait until the next regular
wakeup period.</p>
<p>Each time the configuration file is re-read a message is reported in the
LOG file, so you can tail it (or view it via the CGI interface) to make
sure your kill -HUP worked. Errors in parsing the configuration file are
also reported in the LOG file.</p>
<p>The optional per-VolumeSet configuration file (/etc/BackupAFS/volsets/<em>VolumeSet_Name</em>.pl
is read whenever it is needed by BackupAFS_dump, BackupAFS_compress and others.</p>
<p>

<h1><a name="configuration_parameters">Configuration Parameters</a></h1>
<p>The configuration parameters are divided into five general groups.
The first group (general server configuration) provides general
configuration for BackupAFS. The next two groups describe what to
backup, when to do it, and how long to keep it. The fourth group
are settings for email reminders, and the final group contains
settings for the CGI interface.</p>
<p>All configuration settings in the second through fifth groups can
be overridden by the per-VolumeSet config.pl file.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="general_server_configuration">General server configuration</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="_conf_serverhost_" class="item">$Conf{ServerHost} = '';</a></strong></dt>

</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="_conf_serverport_" class="item">$Conf{ServerPort} = -1;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>TCP port number on which the BackupAFS server listens for and accepts
connections. Normally this should be disabled (set to -1). The TCP
port is only needed if apache runs on a different machine from BackupAFS.
In that case, set this to any spare port number over 1024 (eg: 2359).
If you enable the TCP port, make sure you set <a href="#_conf_servermesgsecret_">$Conf{ServerMesgSecret}</a>
too!</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>Shared secret to make the TCP port secure. Set this to a hard to guess
string if you enable the TCP port (ie: <a href="#_conf_serverport_">$Conf{ServerPort}</a> &gt; 0).</p>
<p>To avoid possible attacks via the TCP socket interface, every client
message is protected by an MD5 digest. The MD5 digest includes four
items:
  - a seed that is sent to the client when the connection opens
  - a sequence number that increments for each message
  - a shared secret that is stored in <a href="#_conf_servermesgsecret_">$Conf{ServerMesgSecret}</a>
  - the message itself.</p>
<p>The message is sent in plain text preceded by the MD5 digest. A
snooper can see the plain-text seed sent by BackupAFS and plain-text
message from the client, but cannot construct a valid MD5 digest since
the secret <a href="#_conf_servermesgsecret_">$Conf{ServerMesgSecret}</a> is unknown. A replay attack is
not possible since the seed changes on a per-connection and
per-message basis.</p>

<p>Times at which we wake up, check all the volumesets, and schedule necessary

fractional if necessary (eg: 4.25 means 4:15am).</p>
<p>If the volsets you are backing up are always available (ie, not at the end
of a dialup link, or are not in another country), you might only have one wakeup each night.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are backing
up volumesets that are only intermittently connected to the network you
might need multiple wakeup times.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

<p>The default value is 23 (11:00PM).</p>
<p>The first entry of <a href="#_conf_wakeupschedule_">$Conf{WakeupSchedule}</a> is when BackupAFS_nightly is run.

<p>Typically this is set slightly less than an integer number of days. The

<p>In the steady state, each time a full backup completes successfully
the oldest one is removed. If this number is decreased, the
extra old backups will be removed.</p>
<p>If filling of incremental dumps is off the oldest backup always
has to be a full (ie: filled) dump. This might mean one or two
extra full dumps are kept until the oldest incremental backups expire.</p>
<p>Exponential backup expiry is also supported. This allows you to specify:</p>
<pre>
  - num fulls to keep at intervals of 1 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>, followed by
  - num fulls to keep at intervals of 2 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>,
  - num fulls to keep at intervals of 4 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>,

  - num fulls to keep at intervals of 16 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>,</pre>
<p>and so on. This works by deleting every other full as each expiry

<p>Exponential expiry is specified using an array for <a href="#_conf_fullkeepcnt_">$Conf{FullKeepCnt}</a>:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="#_conf_fullkeepcnt_">$Conf{FullKeepCnt}</a> = [4, 2, 3];</pre>

2^n * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a> (ie: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...).</p>
<p>The example above specifies keeping 4 of the most recent full backups
(1 week interval) two full backups at 2 week intervals, and 3 full
backups at 4 week intervals, eg:</p>

   full 0 19 weeks old   \
   full 1 15 weeks old    &gt;---  3 backups at 4 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>

   full 7  1 week old     /
   full 8  current       /</pre>
<p>On a given week the spacing might be less than shown as each backup
ages through each expiry period. For example, one week later, a
new full is completed and the oldest is deleted, giving:</p>
<pre>
   full 0 16 weeks old   \
   full 1 12 weeks old    &gt;---  3 backups at 4 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>
   full 2  8 weeks old   /
   full 3  6 weeks old   \____  2 backups at 2 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>

   full 5  3 weeks old   \
   full 6  2 weeks old    \___  4 backups at 1 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>
   full 7  1 week old     /
   full 8  current       /</pre>
<p>You can specify 0 as a count (except in the first entry), and the
array can be as long as you wish. For example:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="#_conf_fullkeepcnt_">$Conf{FullKeepCnt}</a> = [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2];</pre>
<p>This will keep 10 full dumps, 4 most recent at 1 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>,
followed by 4 at an interval of 4 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a> (approx 1 month
apart), and then 2 at an interval of 32 * <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a> (approx

<dd>
<p>Very old incremental backups are removed after <a href="#_conf_incragemax_">$Conf{IncrAgeMax}</a> days.
However, we keep at least <a href="#_conf_incrkeepcntmin_">$Conf{IncrKeepCntMin}</a> incremental backups no

</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="_conf_incrlevels_" class="item">$Conf{IncrLevels} = [1];</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Level of each incremental. &quot;Level&quot; follows the terminology
of <code>dump(1)</code>. A full backup has level 0. A new incremental
of level N will backup all files that have changed since
the most recent backup of a lower level.</p>
<p>The entries of <a href="#_conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</a> apply in order to each
incremental after each full backup. It wraps around until
the next full backup. For example, these two settings
have the same effect:</p>
<pre>
      <a href="#_conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</a> = [1, 2, 3];
      <a href="#_conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</a> = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3];</pre>
<p>This means the 1st and 4th incrementals (level 1) go all
the way back to the full. The 2nd and 3rd (and 5th and
6th) backups just go back to the immediate preceeding
incremental.</p>
<p>Specifying a sequence of multi-level incrementals will
usually mean more than <a href="#_conf_incrkeepcnt_">$Conf{IncrKeepCnt}</a> incrementals will
need to be kept, since lower level incrementals are needed
to merge a complete view of a backup. For example, with</p>
<pre>
      <a href="#_conf_fullperiod_">$Conf{FullPeriod}</a>  = 7;
      <a href="#_conf_incrperiod_">$Conf{IncrPeriod}</a>  = 1;
      <a href="#_conf_incrkeepcnt_">$Conf{IncrKeepCnt}</a> = 6;
      <a href="#_conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</a>  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];</pre>
<p>there will be up to 11 incrementals in this case:</p>
<pre>
      backup #0  (full, level 0, oldest)
      backup #1  (incr, level 1)
      backup #2  (incr, level 2)
      backup #3  (incr, level 3)
      backup #4  (incr, level 4)
      backup #5  (incr, level 5)
      backup #6  (incr, level 6)
      backup #7  (full, level 0)
      backup #8  (incr, level 1)
      backup #9  (incr, level 2)
      backup #10 (incr, level 3)
      backup #11 (incr, level 4)
      backup #12 (incr, level 5, newest)</pre>
<p>Backup #1 (the oldest level 1 incremental) can't be deleted
since backups 2..6 depend on it. Those 6 incrementals can't
all be deleted since that would only leave 5 (#8..12).
When the next incremental happens (level 6), the complete
set of 6 older incrementals (#1..6) will be deleted, since
that maintains the required number (<a href="#_conf_incrkeepcnt_">$Conf{IncrKeepCnt}</a>)
of incrementals. This situation is reduced if you set
shorter chains of multi-level incrementals, eg:</p>
<pre>
      <a href="#_conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</a>  = [1, 2, 3];</pre>
<p>would only have up to 2 extra incremenals before all 3
are deleted.</p>
<p>BackupAFS as usual merges the full and the sequence
of incrementals together so each incremental can be
browsed and restored as though it is a complete backup.
If you specify a long chain of incrementals then more
backups need to be merged when browsing, restoring,
or getting the starting point for rsync backups.
In the example above (levels 1..6), browing backup
#6 requires 7 different backups (#0..6) to be merged.</p>
<p>Because of this merging and the additional incrementals
that need to be kept, it is recommended that some
level 1 incrementals be included in <a href="#_conf_incrlevels_">$Conf{IncrLevels}</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to version 3.0 incrementals were always level 1,
meaning each incremental backed up all the files that
changed since the last full.</p>

the week where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday etc.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
   <a href="#_conf_blackoutperiods_">$Conf{BlackoutPeriods}</a> = [
        {
            hourBegin =&gt;  7.0,

            weekDays  =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        },
   ];</pre>
<p>specifies one blackout period from 7:00am to 7:30pm local time
on Mon-Fri.</p>
<p>The blackout period can also span midnight by setting
hourBegin &gt; hourEnd, eg:</p>
<pre>
   <a href="#_conf_blackoutperiods_">$Conf{BlackoutPeriods}</a> = [
        {
            hourBegin =&gt;  7.0,

            weekDays  =&gt; [5, 6],
        },

<p>This specifies one blackout period from 7:00am to 7:30pm local time

Set this to undef or an empty string to turn off this check.</p>
<p><a href="#_conf_cgiuserurlcreate_">$Conf{CgiUserUrlCreate}</a> should be a full URL that points to the
user's home page. Set this to undef or an empty string to turn
off generation of URLs for user names.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<h1><a name="migrating_from_backuppc4afs">Migrating from BackupPC4AFS</a></h1>
<p>While both software applications are based on BackupPC, there are several notable functional differences between BackupPC4AFS and BackupAFS.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="migrating_volumesets">Migrating VolumeSets</a></h2>
<p>If you have not been using the AFS &quot;backup&quot; database (whether using butc, BackupPC4AFS, etc), you may safely skip this section.</p>
<p>BackupPC4AFS stored the definition of exactly which volumes are included in a specific volumeset in the AFS backup database. BackupAFS stores this definition in the VolumeSet-List file. The exact format of the VolumeSet-List file is covered in Step 6: Setting up the VolumeSet-List file portion of the installation instructions.</p>
<p>BackupPC4AFS prefixed all AFS volume sets with &quot;afs_&quot;, which was used internally to indicate to BackupPC4AFS that a specific volumeset (host) actually represented a set of volumes to dump. <strong>BackupAFS does NOT do this. The name of the volumeset is used as recorded in the VolumeSet-List file.</strong></p>
<p>To facilitate the migration of volumesets and their definitions (volume entries) from the AFS database to the BackupAFS VolumeSet-List file, a migration script, BackupAFS_migrate_populate_VolSet-List is included with the distribution.</p>
<p>&quot;BackupAFS_migrate_populate_VolSet-List&quot; takes no arguments. It queries the AFS backup database and outputs its best guess at correct VolumeSet names and corresponding volume entries on STDOUT. It does expect to be able to query the backup database using the -localauth option, therefore it should be executed after the cell's KeyFile is already installed on the BackupAFS server.</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of volume entries in BackupAFS is limited to 5. This means that existing volume sets, stored in the AFS backup database, which have more than 5 volume entries, will be truncated to 5 entries. It is advised to check the output and add any missing entries to a new VolumeSet in BackupAFS (either via the CGI or by editing the VolumeSet-List file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AFS backup database has no notion of user ownership of volume sets. Therefore the contents of the &quot;users&quot; and &quot;moreUsers&quot; fields will be blank. These can be set after migration, if desired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The migration script must be executed as a user with permissions to run &quot;backup -localauth&quot; and permission to write to the /etc/BackupAFS/VolSet-List file. This is usually backup or root.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended to run a test first:</p>
<pre>
    cd /etc/BackupAFS
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_migrate_populate_VolSet-List
    backup: waiting for job termination
    test_all:::.*:.*:test\..*\.backup::::::::::::</pre>
<p>Note that the line beginning &quot;backup: waiting...&quot; is on STDERR, not STDOUT. If the output looks amenable, add it to the VolumeSet-List file:</p>
<pre>
    cd /etc/BackupAFS
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_migrate_populate_VolSet-List &gt;&gt; VolumeSet-List
    backup: waiting for job termination</pre>
<p>Any volsets with more than 5 volume entries will be omitted and you will be warned by BackupAFS_migrate_populate_VolSet-List. Make sure to check the results for sanity to make sure it looks correct for your cell.</p>
<pre>
    cd /etc/BackupAFS
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_migrate_populate_VolSet-List &gt;&gt; VolumeSet-List
    backup: waiting for job termination
    test1 has more than 5 volentries. Omitting &quot;    Entry   6: server .*, partition .*, volumes: e30.*\.backup&quot;
    test1 has more than 5 volentries. Omitting &quot;    Entry   7: server .*, partition .*, volumes: d70.*\.backup&quot;
    test1 has more than 5 volentries. Omitting &quot;    Entry   8: server .*, partition .*, volumes: oar.*\.backup&quot;
    test1 has more than 5 volentries. Omitting &quot;    Entry   9: server .*, partition .*, volumes: r90.*\.backup&quot;
    test2 has more than 5 volentries. Omitting &quot;    Entry   6: server .*, partition .*, volumes: d70\..*\.backup&quot;</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="unmangling_the_existing_backups">Unmangling the Existing Backups</a></h2>
<p>If you are not migrating from BackupPC4AFS, you may safely skip this section.</p>
<p>BackupPC4AFS stored its dump data in files which had &quot;mangled&quot; names. Name mangling is a concept used by BackupPC (the product on which BackupPC4AFS and BackupAFS are based) to avoid namespace collisions and to allow it to store files' metadata separately from the file itself. BackupPC4AFS went with the flow and mangled filenames because the CGI interface understood mangled names by default.</p>
<p>BackupAFS does not mangle file names. Therefore it is recommended to unmangle the existing backups to prevent confusion.</p>
<p>Additionally, the default backup directory (datadir) in BackupPC4AFS is <a href="#_conf_topdir_">$Conf{TopDir}</a>/pc. For example, /srv/BackupPC/pc. BackupAFS stores its volume backups in <a href="#_conf_topdir_">$Conf{TopDir}</a>/volsets. For example, __TOPDIR__/volsets.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the section above, BackupPC4AFS prefixed all AFS volume sets with &quot;afs_&quot;, which was used internally to indicate to BackupPC4AFS that a specific volumeset (host) actually represented a set of volumes to dump. <strong>BackupAFS does NOT do this. The name of the volumeset is used as recorded in the VolumeSet-List file.</strong> BackupAFS_migrate_unmangle_datadir renames the data directories to remove the &quot;afs_&quot; prefix. ($volsetname=~s^afs_//;)</p>
<p>To ease migration, BackupAFS comes with a script, BackupAFS_migrate_unmangle_datadir to move any existing backups from the BackupPC4AFS directory structure and names to that expected by BackupAFS.</p>
<p>BackupAFS_migrate_unmangle_datadir takes one argument, the defined TopDir, passed in as --topdir=path. When properly executed, the script takes no action itself. It merely outputs, to STDOUT, a bourne-shell script which contains the actions that are necessary. This gives the admin a chance to review the output for sanity prior to execution.</p>
<pre>
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_migrate_unmangle_datadir --topdir=__INSTALLDIR__ &gt;&gt; /tmp/unmangle.sh
    less /tmp/unmangle.sh                                                # Please review for correctness.
    chmod u+rx /tmp/unmangle.sh
    /tmp/unmangle.sh                                                     # This may take some time to execute.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="compression_of_existing_backups">Compression of Existing Backups</a></h2>
<p>If you are not migrating from BackupPC4AFS, you may safely skip this section.</p>
<p>BackupPC4AFS stored its dump data in files which were uncompressed. If available and requested, BackupAFS can compress dumps immediately after they occur in order to save disk space.</p>
<p>The backup and restore routines know how to handle both compressed and uncompressed dumps, so it is not necessary to compress existing dumps, however it is recommended and can save considerable space (35% or more is not uncommon).</p>
<p>If you do decide to compress existing dumps, please do so as instructed here. Manually compressing files outside of these guidelines will not store the compression statistics, and BackupAFS will not be able to accurately report compression savings.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate compression of existing dumps, a script named BackupAFS_migrate_compress_volsets is included in the distribution. This script may be used to schedule the compression of an entire data directory or a single volumeset, to give the administrator flexibility. Compressing the entire data directory may be very time consuming, depending on the volume of existing data and the speed and quantity of processors.</p>
<p>A real-world example: compressing 9.7TB of data (375 full dumps, 6000 incrementals), on a server with (8) 2.66GHz X5355 Xeon processors (using pigz for parallel compression threads) and 4GB of RAM took approximately 20 hours.</p>
<p>The BackupAFS_migrate_compress_volsets script takes either 2 or 3 arguments. --datadir= and --backupuser= are mandatory. --volset is optional, and if specified will operate on only the specified volumeset. If --volset is omitted, then all volumesets will be processed.</p>
<p>The action of the script is to locate all volume dump files (.vdmp files) for each volumeset and add them to a &quot;NewFileList.backupnumber&quot; file inside the volset's directory. Once the &quot;NewFileList&quot; file is constructed, BackupAFS can be requested to perform the compression immediately or it will be performed during the next regularly-scheduled wakeup period (along with any files backed up during that wakeup period).</p>
<p>To compress all backups at once, an admin might do:</p>
<pre>
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_migrate_compress_volsets --datadir=__TOPDIR__ --backupuser=backup
    # Output snipped for documentation purposes, but each file found is echoed on STDOUT</pre>
<p>To compress all backups for ONLY ONE volume set, an admin might do:</p>
<pre>
    __INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_migrate_compress_volsets --datadir=__TOPDIR__ --backupuser=backup --volset=test1
    # Output snipped for documentation purposes, but each file found is echoed on STDOUT</pre>
<p>After performing either of the above steps, to request BackupAFS perform a compression for a given volset immediately, issue the following command, substituting the name of one of your volumesets in the place of &quot;test1&quot; and substituting in the name of the backup user if it is not backup.</p>
<pre>
    su -c &quot;__INSTALLDIR__/bin/BackupAFS_serverMesg compress test1&quot; backup
    Got reply: ok</pre>
<p>The above command may be repeated for each volumeset. Additional compressions will be queued since only one compress operation may occur at any given time. Compressions scheduled via the &quot;BackupAFS_serverMesg compress&quot; method will show up in the CGI (in Status and Current queues) and statistics for it will be recorded in each volumeset's &quot;backups&quot; file.</p>
<p>NOTE that the maximum number of pending jobs that may exist is defined by <a href="#_conf_maxpendingcmds_">$Conf{MaxPendingCmds}</a>. If the number of pending jobs equals or exceeds the value defined there, no new dumps will occur until the number of pending jobs decreases. Therefore you may wish to temporarily increase this number to a very high number if you wish to allow compressions to occur without hampering backups. This would be useful if the expected duration of compression is greater than your backup interval.</p>

<hr />
<h1><a name="version_numbers">Version Numbers</a></h1>
<p>Starting with v1.0.0 BackupAFS uses a X.Y.Z version numbering system.
The first digit is for major new releases, the middle
digit is for significant feature releases and improvements (most of
the releases will likely be in this category), and the last digit is for
bug fixes. You should think of the old 1.00, 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03 as
1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.2.0 and 1.3.0.</p>
<p>Additionally, patches might be made available. A patched version
number is of the form X.Y.ZplN (eg: 2.1.0pl2), where N is the
patch level.</p>
