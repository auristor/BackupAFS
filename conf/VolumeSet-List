# VolSet file list for BackupAFS.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This file lists all the volsets that should be backed up by
#   BackupAFS.
#
#   Each line in the volsets file contains eighteen fields, separated
#   by colons (:)
#
#     - The volset name.  This should be alphanumeric and unique.
#
#     - User name (unix login/email name) of the user who "owns"
#       or uses this volumeset.  This is the user who will be sent
#       email about this machine, and this user will have permission
#       to stop/start/browse/restore backups for this volset.  This
#       user name must match the name the user authenticates with
#       via apache. OPTIONAL
#
#     - Optional additional user names (comma separated, no white space) of
#       users who are also allowed to stop/start/browse/restore backups
#       for this client via the CGI interface.  These users are not sent
#       email.  These do not need to be valid email names; they simply
#       need to match the name the user authenticates with via apache. OPTIONAL
#
#     - Entry1 Servers regular expression. Matching servernames will be queried for
#       matching partitions and volumes
#
#     - Entry1 Partitions regular expression. Matching partition names on the
#       specified servers will be queried for volumes. 
#
#     - Entry1 Volumes regular expression. Matching volumenames on candidate
#       Server/Partition will be backed up when the containing volumeset is
#       backed up. The combination of Server and Partition define one or more
#       locations for candidate volumes. Volumes selects the exact volume(s) to
#       be backed up.
# 
#     - EntryN [Servers|Partitions|Volumes]. It is often useful to combine more
#       than one set of Server/Partition/Volume regular expressions in a single
#       volumeset. Up to 5 triples may be specified in each volumeset. At LEAST
#       one triple must be specified per volumeset. Entries 2-5 are optional and
#       may be blank.
