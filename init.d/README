This directory contains some scripts for auto-starting BackupAFS
on boot.

The subdirectory src contains source versions of these scripts (before
various absolute paths have been filled in).

Here are instrcutions for different OSs.  Please submit additions
or improvements to this list!

RedHat Linux:
============

When configure.pl is run, the script linux-backupafs is created. It
should be copied to /etc/init.d/backupafs:

    cp linux-backupafs /etc/init.d/backupafs

After copying it, you can test it by running these commands as root:

    /etc/init.d/backupafs start
    /etc/init.d/backupafs status
    /etc/init.d/backupafs stop

You should then run the following commands as root:

    chkconfig --add backupafs
    chkconfig --level 345 backupafs on
    chkconfig --list backupafs

This will auto-start backupafs at run levels 3, 4 and 5.

Debian Linux:
============

When configure.pl is run, the script debian-backupafs is created.

Copy the debian startup script:

    cp debian-backupafs /etc/init.d/backupafs

Run the following command to install in rc.d:

    update-rc.d backupafs defaults

Set the correct init.d rights:

    chmod 755 /etc/init.d/backupafs

Usage: /etc/init.d/backupafs {start|stop|restart|reload}

Suse Linux:
==========

When configure.pl is run, the script suse-backupafs is created.

Using Suse 9.0 "chkconfig --level" doesn't work, so you should run:

    chkconfig backupafs 345
    chkconfig --list backupafs

Gentoo Linux:
============

When configure.pl is run, the script gentoo-backupafs and the init conf files
gentoo-backupafs.conf are created. They should be copied to the following
locations:

    cp gentoo-backupafs /etc/init.d/backupafs
    cp gentoo-backupafs.conf /etc/conf.d/backupafs

You can test it by running these commands as root:

    /etc/init.d/backupafs start
    /etc/init.d/backupafs status
    /etc/init.d/backupafs stop

After copying these files, run the following  as root to make BackupAFS to
start automatically at boot (at the default run level):

    rc-update add backupafs default

FreeBSD:
=======

When configure.pl is run, the script freebsd-backupafs is created.

Copy this script to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/backupafs and make
execuatble.

Add the following line to /etc/rc.conf to enable BackupAFS:

backupafs_enable=(bool):   Set to "NO" by default.
                          Set it to "YES" to enable BackupAFS.

Example:

    backupafs_enable="YES"

The script accepts: start, stop, restart, reload, status

Slackware:
=========

When configure.pl is run, the script slackware-backupafs is created.

Install it by running these commands as root:

    cp slackware-backupafs /etc/rc.d/rc.backupafs
    chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.backupafs

then use an editor to add /etc/rc.d/rc.backupafs to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

Solaris:
=======

When configure.pl is run the shell script solaris-backupafs is created.
This should be copied to /etc/init.d and links made in /etc/rc3.d
and /etc/rc0.d.

    cp solaris-backupafs /etc/init.d/backupafs
    ln -s /etc/init.d/backupafs /etc/rc3.d/S85backupafs
    ln -s /etc/init.d/backupafs /etc/rc0.d/K85backupafs

This will auto-start backupafs at run level 3 and stop it at run level 0.

(Can a Solaris user please tell me if these instructions are correct?)
