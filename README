INTRODUCTION:
------------

    BackupAFS is a high-performance, enterprise-grade system for backing up
    OpenAFS volumes to a server's disk. This is a strategy commonly known as
    "disk to disk", or "disk2disk" backup, and thanks to the low cost and
    high performance of modern hard disks, is both fast and economical.
    BackupAFS is highly configurable and easy to install and maintain.

    Given the ever decreasing cost of disks and raid systems, it is now
    practical and cost effective to store backups on a (remote) server's
    local disk or network storage. For some sites this might be the complete
    backup solution. For other sites additional permanent archives could be
    created by periodically backing up the server to tape.

    Features include:

    *   Optional compression provides additional reductions in storage
        (around 35-40%, depending on your data).

    *   A powerful http/cgi user interface allows administrators to view the
        current status, edit configuration, add/delete volumesets, view log
        files, and allows users to initiate and cancel backups and browse
        and restore volumes from backups.

    *   No additional software is needed. BackupAFS uses the OpenAFS 'vos'
        binary and stores its files in standard 'vos dump' format.

    *   Flexible restore options. Volume dump files can be downloaded from
        any backup directly from the CGI interface. Volumes may also be
        restored directly into AFS, overwriting any existing volume of the
        same name or with an optional extension (.restore for instance) to
        prevent namespace collisions.

    *   Flexible configuration parameters allow a configurable number of
        multiple backups to be performed in parallel, specification of which
        volumes to backup, various schedules for full and incremental
        backups, schedules for email notifications to users and admins and
        so on. Configuration parameters can be set system-wide or also on a
        per-volumeset basis.

    *   Admins (and optionally users) may be sent periodic email reminders
        if their volumeset has not recently been backed up. Email content,
        timing and policies are configurable.

    *   BackupAFS is Open Source software hosted by SourceForge.

Credits
    Craig Barratt is the primary author and developer of BackupPC, the
    application on which BackupAFS is largely based. Without BackupPC, and
    the fact that it is GPL'ed software, BackupAFS would not exist.

    Ryan Kucera contributed the directory navigation code and images for
    BackupPC v1.5.0. He contributed the first skeleton of BackupPC_restore.
    He also added a significant revision to the CGI interface, including CSS
    tags, in BackupPC v2.1.0.

    Rich Duzenbury wrote the RSS feed option for the CGI interface.

    Jono Woodhouse from CapeSoft Software (www.capesoft.com) provided a new
    CSS skin for BackupPC v3.0.0 with several layout improvements. Sean
    Cameron (also from CapeSoft) designed new and more compact file icons
    for BackupPC v3.0.0.
